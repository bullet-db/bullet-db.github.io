Depending on what kind of data you put Bullet on, the types of queries you run on it and your use-cases will change. As a look-forward query system with no persistence, you will not be able to repeat your queries on the same data. The next time you run your query, it will operate on the different data that arrives after that submission. If this usage pattern is what you need and you are looking for a light-weight system that can tap into your streaming data, then Bullet is for you!\n\n\nExample: How Bullet is used at Yahoo\n\n\nBullet is used in production internally at Yahoo by having it sit on a subset of raw user engagement events from Yahoo sites and apps. This lets Yahoo developers automatically validate their instrumentation code \nend-to-end\n in their Continuous Delivery pipelines. Validating instrumentation is critical since it powers pretty much all decisions and products including machine learning, corporate KPIs, analytics, personalization, targeting.\n\n\nThis instance of Bullet also powers other use-cases such as letting analysts validate assumptions about data, product managers verify launches instantly, debug issues and outages, or simply explore and play around with the data.\n\n\n\n\nBlog post\n\n\nHere is a \nlink to our blog post\n condensing most of this information if you want to take a look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Start\n\n\nSee \nQuick Start\n to set up Bullet locally using Spark Streaming. You will generate some synthetic streaming data that you can then query with Bullet.\n\n\nSetup Bullet on your streaming data\n\n\nTo set up Bullet on a real data stream, you need:\n\n\n\n\nTo setup the Bullet Backend on a stream processing framework. Currently, we support \nBullet on Storm\n and \nBullet on Spark\n.\n\n\nPlug in your source of data. See \nGetting your data into Bullet\n for details\n\n\nConsume your data stream\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nWeb Service\n set up to convey queries and return results back from the backend\n\n\nTo choose a \nPubSub implementation\n that connects the Web Service and the Backend. We currently support \nKafka\n and a \nREST PubSub\n on any Backend and \nStorm DRPC\n for the Storm Backend.\n\n\nThe optional \nUI\n set up to talk to your Web Service. You can skip the UI if all your access is programmatic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchema in the UI\n\n\nThe UI also needs an endpoint that provides your data schema to help with query building. The Web Service you set up provides a simple file based schema endpoint that you can point the UI to if that is sufficient for your needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuerying in Bullet\n\n\nBullet queries allow you to filter, project and aggregate data. You can also specify a window to get incremental results. Bullet lets you fetch raw (the individual data records) as well as aggregated data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nUI Usage section\n for using the UI to build Bullet queries. This is the same UI you will build in the Quick Starts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the API section (\nBQL\n, or the more verbose, underlying query format - \nJSON\n) for building Bullet API queries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor examples using the API, see \nExamples\n. These are actual albeit cleansed queries sourced from the instance at Yahoo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTermination conditions\n\n\nA Bullet query terminates and returns whatever has been collected so far when:\n\n\n\n\nA maximum duration is reached. In other words, a query runs for a defined time window (which can be infinite).\n\n\nA maximum number of records is reached (only applicable for queries that are fetching raw data records and not aggregating).\n\n\n\n\nFilters\n\n\nBullet supports two kinds of filters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter Type\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogical filter\n\n\nAllow you to combine filter clauses (Logical or Relational) with logical operations like AND, OR and NOTs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelational filters\n\n\nAllow you to use comparison operations like equals, not equals, greater than, less than, regex like etc, on fields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjections\n\n\nProjections allow you to pull out only the fields needed and rename them when you are querying for raw data records.\n\n\nAggregations\n\n\nAggregations allow you to perform some operation on the collected records.\n\n\nThe current aggregation types that are supported are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregation\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGROUP\n\n\nThe resulting output would be a record containing the result of an operation for each unique value combination in your specified fields\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOUNT DISTINCT\n\n\nComputes the number of distinct elements in the fields. (May be approximate)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIMIT or RAW\n\n\nThe resulting output would be at most the number specified in size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\n\nComputes distributions of the elements in the field. E.g. Find the median value or various percentile of a field, or get frequency or cumulative frequency distributions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP K\n\n\nReturns the top K most frequently appearing values in the column\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently we support \nGROUP\n aggregations with the following operations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOUNT\n\n\nComputes the number of the elements in the group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUM\n\n\nComputes the sum of the non-null values in the provided field for all elements in the group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMIN\n\n\nReturns the minimum of the non-null values in the provided field for all the elements in the group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAX\n\n\nReturns the maximum of the non-null values in the provided field for all the elements in the group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAVG\n\n\nComputes the average of the non-null values in the provided field for all the elements in the group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nWindows in a Bullet query allow you to specify how often you'd like Bullet to return results.\n\n\nFor example, you could launch a query for 2 minutes, and have Bullet return a COUNT DISTINCT on a particular field every 3 seconds:\n\n\n\n\nSee documentation on the Web Service API for more info.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe Bullet Web Service returns your query result as well as associated metadata information in a structured JSON format. The UI can display the results in different formats.\n\n\n\n\nApproximate computation\n\n\nIt is often intractable to perform aggregations on an unbounded stream of data and still support arbitrary queries. However, it is possible if an exact answer is not required and the approximate answer's error is exactly quantifiable. There are stochastic algorithms and data structures that let us do this. We use \nData Sketches\n to perform aggregations such as counting uniques, and will be using Sketches to implement some future aggregations.\n\n\nSketches let us be exact in our computation up to configured thresholds and approximate after. The error is very controllable and quantifiable. All Bullet queries that use Sketches return the error bounds with Standard Deviations as part of the results so you can quantify the error exactly. Using Sketches lets us address otherwise hard to solve problems in sub-linear space. We uses Sketches to compute \nCOUNT DISTINCT\n, \nGROUP\n, \nDISTRIBUTION\n and \nTOP K\n queries.\n\n\nWe also use Sketches as a way to control high cardinality grouping (group by a natural key column or related) and rely on the Sketching data structure to drop excess groups. It is up to you setting up Bullet to determine to set Sketch sizes large or small enough for to satisfy the queries that will be performed on that instance of Bullet.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nEnd-to-End Architecture\n\n\n\n\nThe image above shows how the various pieces of the Bullet interact at a high-level. All these layers are modular and pluggable. You can choose an implementation for the Backend and the PubSub (or create your own). The core of Bullet is abstracted into a \nlibrary\n that can be reused to implement the Backend, Web Service and PubSub layers in a platform agnostic manner.\n\n\n\n\nBackend\n\n\n\n\nThe Bullet Backend can be split into three main conceptual sub-systems:\n\n\n\n\nRequest Processor - receives queries, adds metadata and sends it to the rest of the system\n\n\nData Processor - reads data from a input stream, converts it to an unified data format and matches it against queries\n\n\nCombiner - combines results for different queries, performs final aggregations and returns results\n\n\n\n\nThe core of Bullet querying is not tied to the Backend and lives in a core library. This allows you implement the flow shown above in any stream processor you like.\n\n\nImplementations of \nBullet on Storm\n and \nBullet on Spark\n are currently supported.\n\n\nPubSub\n\n\nThe PubSub is responsible for transmitting queries from the API to the Backend and returning results back from the Backend to the clients. It decouples whatever particular Backend you are using with the API.\nWe currently support three different PubSub implementations:\n\n\n\n\nKafka\n\n\nREST\n\n\nStorm DRPC\n (only for non-windowed queries)\n\n\n\n\nYou can also very easily \nimplement your own\n by defining a few interfaces that we provide.\n\n\nWeb Service and UI\n\n\nThe rest of the pieces are just the standard other two pieces in a full-stack application:\n\n\n\n\nA Web Service that talks to the backend using the PubSub layer\n\n\nA UI that talks to this Web Service\n\n\n\n\nThe \nBullet Web Service\n is built using \nSpring Boot\n in Java and the \nUI\n is built in \nEmber\n.\n\n\nThe Web Service can be deployed as a standalone Java application (a JAR file) or easily rebuilt as a WAR to deploy your favorite servlet container like \nJetty\n. The UI is a client-side application that can be served using \nNode.js\n\n\n\n\nWant to know more?\n\n\nIn practice, the backend is implemented using the basic components that the Stream processing framework provides.

You can then \ncontinue this guide from here\n.\n\n\n\n\nWant to DIY?\n\n\nIf you want to manually run all the commands or if the script died while doing something above (might want to perform the \nteardown\n first), you can continue below.\n\n\n\n\nManual Installation\n\n\nStep 1: Setup directories and examples\n\n\nexport BULLET_HOME=$(pwd)/bullet-quickstart\nmkdir -p $BULLET_HOME/backend/spark\nmkdir -p $BULLET_HOME/pubsub\nmkdir -p $BULLET_HOME/service\nmkdir -p $BULLET_HOME/ui\ncd $BULLET_HOME\ncurl -LO https://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-db.github.io/releases/download/v0.6.0/examples_artifacts.tar.gz\ntar -xzf examples_artifacts.tar.gz\nexport BULLET_EXAMPLES=$BULLET_HOME/bullet-examples\n\n\n\n\nSetup Kafka\n\n\nFor this instance of Bullet we will use the Kafka PubSub implementation found in \nbullet-spark\n. So we will first download and run Kafka, and setup a couple Kafka topics.\n\n\nStep 2: Download and Install Kafka\n\n\ncd $BULLET_HOME/pubsub\ncurl -Lo bullet-kafka.jar http://jcenter.bintray.com/com/yahoo/bullet/bullet-kafka/0.3.2/bullet-kafka-0.3.2-fat.jar\ncurl -LO https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/0.11.0.1/kafka_2.12-0.11.0.1.tgz\ntar -xzf kafka_2.12-0.11.0.1.tgz\nexport KAFKA_DIR=$BULLET_HOME/pubsub/kafka_2.12-0.11.0.1\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Start Zookeeper\n\n\n$KAFKA_DIR/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh $KAFKA_DIR/config/zookeeper.properties \n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Start Kafka\n\n\nGive Zookeeper ~5-10 seconds to start up, then start Kafka:\n\n\n$KAFKA_DIR/bin/kafka-server-start.sh $KAFKA_DIR/config/server.properties \n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Create Kafka Topics\n\n\nThe Bullet Kafka PubSub uses two topics. One to send messages from the Web Service to the Backend, and one to send messages from the Backend to the Web Service. So we will create a Kafka topic called \"bullet.requests\" and another called \"bullet.responses\".\n\n\n$KAFKA_DIR/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic bullet.requests\n$KAFKA_DIR/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic bullet.responses\n\n\n\n\nSetup Bullet Backend on Spark\n\n\nWe will run the bullet-spark backend using \nSpark 2.2.1\n.\n\n\nStep 6: Install Spark 2.2.1\n\n\nexport BULLET_SPARK=$BULLET_HOME/backend/spark\ncd $BULLET_SPARK\ncurl -O https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.2.1/spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz\ntar -xzf spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Setup Bullet-Spark and Example Data Producer\n\n\ncp $BULLET_HOME/bullet-examples/backend/spark/* $BULLET_SPARK\ncurl -Lo bullet-spark.jar http://jcenter.bintray.com/com/yahoo/bullet/bullet-spark/0.2.1/bullet-spark-0.2.1-standalone.jar\n\n\n\n\nStep 8: Launch the Bullet Spark Backend\n\n\nRun this multi-line command (new lines are escaped):\n\n\n$BULLET_SPARK/spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit \\\n    --master local[10]  \\\n    --class com.yahoo.bullet.spark.BulletSparkStreamingMain \\\n    --jars $BULLET_HOME/pubsub/bullet-kafka.jar,$BULLET_SPARK/bullet-spark-example.jar \\\n    $BULLET_SPARK/bullet-spark.jar \\\n    --bullet-spark-conf=$BULLET_SPARK/bullet_spark_kafka_settings.yaml \n log.txt \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Backend will usually be up and running usually within 5-10 seconds. Once it is running you can get information about the Spark job in the Spark UI, which can be seen in your browser at \nhttp://localhost:4040\n by default. The Web Service will now be hooked up through the Kafka PubSub to the Spark backend. To test it you can now run a Bullet query by hitting the Web Service directly:\n\n\nSetup Web Service\n\n\nStep 9: Install the Bullet Web Service\n\n\ncd $BULLET_HOME/service\ncurl -Lo bullet-service.jar http://jcenter.bintray.com/com/yahoo/bullet/bullet-service/0.4.3/bullet-service-0.4.3-embedded.jar\ncp $BULLET_EXAMPLES/web-service/example_kafka_pubsub_config.yaml $BULLET_HOME/service/\ncp $BULLET_EXAMPLES/web-service/example_columns.json $BULLET_HOME/service/\n\n\n\n\nStep 10: Launch the Web Service\n\n\nRun this multi-line command (new lines are escaped):\n\n\njava -Dloader.path=$BULLET_HOME/pubsub/bullet-kafka.jar -jar bullet-service.jar \\\n    --bullet.pubsub.config=$BULLET_HOME/service/example_kafka_pubsub_config.yaml \\\n    --bullet.schema.file=$BULLET_HOME/service/example_columns.json \\\n    --server.port=9999  \\\n    --logging.path=. \\\n    --logging.file=log.txt \n log.txt \n\n\n\n\n\nStep 11: Test the Web Service (optional)\n\n\nWe can check that the Web Service is up and running by getting the example columns through the API:\n\n\ncurl -s http://localhost:9999/api/bullet/columns\n\n\n\n\ncurl -s -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -X POST -d '{\naggregation\n: {\nsize\n: 1}}' http://localhost:9999/api/bullet/sse-query\n\n\n\n\nThis query will return a result JSON containing a \"records\" field containing a single record, and a \"meta\" field with some meta information.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is this data?\n\n\nThis data is randomly generated by the \ncustom Spark Streaming Receiver\n that generates toy data to demo Bullet. In practice, your producer would read from an actual data source such as Kafka etc.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also check the status of the Web Service by looking at the Web Service log: $BULLET_HOME/service/log.txt\n\n\nSetting up the Bullet UI\n\n\nStep 12: Install Node\n\n\ncd $BULLET_HOME/ui\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.1/install.sh | bash\nsource ~/.bashrc\nnvm install v6.9.4\nnvm use v6.9.4\n\n\n\n\nStep 13: Install the Bullet UI\n\n\ncurl -LO https://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-ui/releases/download/v0.6.1/bullet-ui-v0.6.1.tar.gz\ntar -xzf bullet-ui-v0.6.1.tar.gz\ncp $BULLET_EXAMPLES/ui/env-settings.json config/\n\n\n\n\nStep 14: Launch the UI\n\n\nPORT=8800 node express-server.js \n\n\n\n\n\nVisit \nhttp://localhost:8800\n to query your topology with the UI. See \nUI usage\n for some example queries and interactions using this UI. You see what the Schema means by visiting the Schema section.\n\n\n\n\nRunning it remotely?\n\n\nIf you access the UI from another machine than where your UI is actually running, you will need to edit \nconfig/env-settings.json\n. Since the UI is a client-side app, the machine that your browser is running on will fetch the UI and attempt to use these settings to talk to the Web Service. Since they point to localhost by default, your browser will attempt to connect there and fail. An easy fix is to change \nlocalhost\n in your env-settings.json to point to the host name where you will hosting the UI. This will be the same as the UI host you use in the browser. You can also do a local port forward on the machine accessing the UI by running: \nssh -N -L 8800:localhost:8800 -L 9999:localhost:9999 hostname-of-the-quickstart-components 2\n1\n.\n\n\n\n\nPlaying around with the instance:\n\n\nCheck out and follow along with the \nUI Usage\n page as it shows you some queries you can run using this UI.\n\n\nTeardown\n\n\nWhen you are done trying out Bullet, you can stop the processes and cleanup using the instructions below.\n\n\nIf you were using the \nInstall Script\n or if you don't want to manually bring down everything, you can run:\n\n\ncurl -sLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bullet-db/bullet-db.github.io/src/examples/install-all-spark.sh | bash -s cleanup\n\n\n\n\nIf you were performing the steps yourself, you can also manually cleanup \nall the components and all the downloads\n using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUI\n\n\npkill -f [e]xpress-server.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Service\n\n\npkill -f [e]xample_kafka_pubsub_config.yaml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpark\n\n\npkill -f [b]ullet-spark\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKafka\n\n\n${KAFKA_DIR}/bin/kafka-server-stop.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZookeeper\n\n\n${KAFKA_DIR}/bin/zookeeper-server-stop.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile System\n\n\nrm -rf $BULLET_HOME /tmp/zookeeper /tmp/kafka-logs/ /tmp/spark-checkpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This does \nnot\n delete \n$HOME/.nvm\n.\n\n\nWhat did we do?\n\n\nThis section will go over the various custom pieces this example plugged into Bullet, so you can better understand what we did.\n\n\nSpark Streaming Job\n\n\nThe Spark Streaming application we ran was Bullet plugged in with a custom Receiver in our implementation of the Bullet Spark DataProducer trait. This Receiver and DataProducer are implemented in this \nexample project\n and was already built for you when you \ndownloaded the examples\n. It does not read from any data source and just produces random, structured data. It also produces only up to a maximum number of records in a given period. Both this maximum and the length of a period are configured in the Receiver (at most 100 every 1 second).\n\n\n$BULLET_SPARK/spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit \\\n    --master local[10]  \\\n    --class com.yahoo.bullet.spark.BulletSparkStreamingMain \\\n    --jars $BULLET_HOME/pubsub/bullet-kafka.jar,$BULLET_SPARK/bullet-spark-example.jar \\\n    $BULLET_SPARK/bullet-spark.jar \\\n    --bullet-spark-conf=$BULLET_SPARK/bullet_spark_kafka_settings.yaml \n log.txt \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe launched the bullet-spark jar (an uber or \"fat\" jar) containing Bullet Spark and all its dependencies. We added our Pubsub (see below) implementation and our jar containing our custom Receiver to the Spark job's additional jars.\n\n\nThe settings defined by \n--bullet-spark-conf=$BULLET_SPARK/bullet_spark_kafka_settings.yaml\n and the arguments here run all components in the Spark Streaming job.\n\n\n\n\nI thought you said hundreds of thousands of records...\n\n\n100 records per second is not Big Data by any stretch of the imagination but this Quick Start is running everything on one machine and is meant to introduce you to what Bullet does. In practice, you would scale and run your components with CPU and memory configurations to accommodate for your data volume and querying needs.\n\n\n\n\nLet's look at the \ncustom Receiver code\n that generates the data.\n\n\n  private def receive(): Unit = {\n    nextIntervalStart = System.currentTimeMillis()\n    while (!isStopped) {\n      val timeNow = System.currentTimeMillis()\n      // Only emit if we are still in the interval and haven't gone over our per period max\n      if (timeNow \n= nextIntervalStart \n generatedThisPeriod \n maxPerPeriod) {\n        store(generateRecord())\n        generatedThisPeriod += 1\n      }\n      if (timeNow \n nextIntervalStart) {\n        logger.info(\nGenerated {} tuples out of {}\n, generatedThisPeriod, maxPerPeriod)\n        nextIntervalStart = timeNow + period\n        generatedThisPeriod = 0\n        periodCount += 1\n      }\n      // It is courteous to sleep for a short time.\n      try {\n        Thread.sleep(1)\n      } catch {\n        case e: InterruptedException =\n logger.error(\nError: \n, e)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\n\nThis method above emits the data. This method is wrapped in a thread that is called by the Spark framework. This function only emits at most the given maximum tuples per period.\n\n\n  private def makeRandomMap: Map[java.lang.String, java.lang.String] = {\n    val randomMap = new HashMap[java.lang.String, java.lang.String](2)\n    randomMap.put(RandomReceiver.RANDOM_MAP_KEY_A, RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL(Random.nextInt(RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL.length)))\n    randomMap.put(RandomReceiver.RANDOM_MAP_KEY_B, RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL(Random.nextInt(RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL.length)))\n    randomMap\n  }\n\n  private def generateRecord(): BulletRecord = {\n    val record = new SimpleBulletRecord()\n    val uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString\n    record.setString(RandomReceiver.STRING, uuid)\n    record.setLong(RandomReceiver.LONG, generatedThisPeriod)\n    record.setDouble(RandomReceiver.DOUBLE, Random.nextDouble())\n    record.setDouble(RandomReceiver.GAUSSIAN, Random.nextGaussian())\n    record.setString(RandomReceiver.TYPE, RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL(Random.nextInt(RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL.length)))\n    record.setLong(RandomReceiver.DURATION, System.nanoTime() % RandomReceiver.INTEGER_POOL(Random.nextInt(RandomReceiver.INTEGER_POOL.length)))\n\n    // Don't use Scala Map and convert it by asJava when calling setxxxMap method in BulletRecord.\n    // It converts Scala Map to scala.collection.convert.Wrappers$MapWrapper which is not serializable in scala 2.11.x (https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8911).\n\n    record.setStringMap(RandomReceiver.SUBTYPES_MAP, makeRandomMap);\n\n    val booleanMap = new HashMap[java.lang.String, java.lang.Boolean](4)\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(0, 8), Random.nextBoolean())\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(9, 13), Random.nextBoolean())\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(14, 18), Random.nextBoolean())\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(19, 23), Random.nextBoolean())\n    record.setBooleanMap(RandomReceiver.BOOLEAN_MAP, booleanMap)\n\n\n    val statsMap = new HashMap[java.lang.String, java.lang.Long](4)\n    statsMap.put(RandomReceiver.PERIOD_COUNT, periodCount)\n    statsMap.put(RandomReceiver.RECORD_NUMBER, periodCount * maxPerPeriod + generatedThisPeriod)\n    statsMap.put(RandomReceiver.NANO_TIME, System.nanoTime())\n    statsMap.put(RandomReceiver.TIMESTAMP, System.nanoTime())\n    record.setLongMap(RandomReceiver.STATS_MAP, statsMap)\n\n    record.setListOfStringMap(RandomReceiver.LIST, asList(makeRandomMap, makeRandomMap))\n    record\n  }\n\n\n\n\nThis \ngenerateRecord\n method generates some fields randomly and inserts them into a BulletRecord (simple). Note that the BulletRecord is typed and all data must be inserted with the proper types.\n\n\nThis whole receiver is plugged into an implementation of the Spark DataProducer trait that Bullet Spark requires to plug in your data (as a Spark DStream) into it. You can find this class implemented \nhere\n and reproduced below.\n\n\npackage com.yahoo.bullet.spark.examples\n\nimport com.yahoo.bullet.record.BulletRecord\nimport com.yahoo.bullet.spark.DataProducer\nimport com.yahoo.bullet.spark.examples.receiver.RandomReceiver\nimport com.yahoo.bullet.spark.utils.BulletSparkConfig\nimport org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext\nimport org.apache.spark.streaming.dstream.DStream\n\nclass RandomProducer extends DataProducer {\n  override def getBulletRecordStream(ssc: StreamingContext, config: BulletSparkConfig): DStream[BulletRecord] = {\n    // Bullet record input stream.\n    val bulletReceiver = new RandomReceiver(config)\n    ssc.receiverStream(bulletReceiver).asInstanceOf[DStream[BulletRecord]]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you put Bullet on your data, you will need to write a DataProducer (or a full on Spark DAG if your reading is complex), that reads from your data source and emits a DStream of BulletRecords with the fields you wish to be query-able similar to this example.\n\n\nPubSub\n\n\nWe used the \nKafka PubSub\n. We configured the Backend to use this PubSub by adding these settings to the YAML file that we passed to our Spark Streaming job. Notice that we set the context to \nQUERY_PROCESSING\n since this is the Backend.\n\n\nbullet.pubsub.context.name: \nQUERY_PROCESSING\n\nbullet.pubsub.class.name: \ncom.yahoo.bullet.kafka.KafkaPubSub\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.bootstrap.servers: \nlocalhost:9092\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.request.topic.name: \nbullet.requests\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.response.topic.name: \nbullet.responses\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Web Service, we passed in a YAML file that pointed to the same Kafka topics. Notice that we set the context to \nQUERY_SUBMISSION\n since this is the Web Service.\n\n\nbullet.pubsub.context.name: \nQUERY_SUBMISSION\n\nbullet.pubsub.class.name: \ncom.yahoo.bullet.kafka.KafkaPubSub\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.bootstrap.servers: \nlocalhost:9092\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.request.topic.name: \nbullet.requests\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.response.topic.name: \nbullet.responses\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Service\n\n\nWe launched the Web Service using two custom files - a PubSub configuration YAML file and JSON schema file.\n\n\nThe JSON columns file contains the schema for our data specified in JSON. Since our schema is not going to change, we use the Web Service to serve it from a file. If your schema changes dynamically, you will need to provide your own endpoint to the UI.\n\n\nThe following is a snippet from the \nJSON file\n. Notice how the types of the fields are specified. Also, if you have generated BulletRecord with Map fields whose keys are known, you can specify them here using \nenumerations\n.\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \nname\n: \nprobability\n,\n        \ntype\n: \nDOUBLE\n,\n        \ndescription\n: \nGenerated from Random#nextDouble\n\n    },\n    ...\n    {\n        \nname\n: \nstats\n,\n        \ntype\n: \nMAP\n,\n        \nsubtype\n: \nLONG\n,\n        \ndescription\n: \nThis map contains some numeric information such as the current number of periods etc.\n,\n        \nenumerations\n: [\n            ...\n            {\nname\n: \nnano_time\n, \ndescription\n: \nThe ns time when this record was generated\n}\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \nname\n: \nclassifiers\n,\n        \ntype\n: \nLIST\n,\n        \nsubtype\n: \nMAP\n,\n        \ndescription\n: \nThis contains two maps, each with: field_A and field_B whose values are randomly chosen from: foo, bar, baz, qux, quux, norf\n\n    }\n]\n\n\n\n\nThe contents of the \nPubSub configuration file\n was discussed in the \nPubSub section above\n.\n\n\nUI\n\n\nFinally, we configured the UI with the custom environment specific settings file. We did not add any environments since we only had the one.\n\n\n{\n  \ndefault\n: {\n    \nqueryHost\n: \nhttp://localhost:9999\n,\n    \nqueryNamespace\n: \napi/bullet\n,\n    \nqueryPath\n: \nws-query\n,\n    \nqueryStompRequestChannel\n: \n/server/request\n,\n    \nqueryStompResponseChannel\n: \n/client/response\n,\n    \nschemaHost\n: \nhttp://localhost:9999\n,\n    \nschemaNamespace\n: \napi/bullet\n,\n    \nhelpLinks\n: [\n      {\n        \nname\n: \nTutorials\n,\n        \nlink\n: \nhttps://bullet-db.github.io/ui/usage\n\n      }\n    ],\n    \nbugLink\n: \nhttps://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-ui/issues\n,\n    \nmodelVersion\n: 3,\n    \nmigrations\n: {\n      \ndeletions\n: \nquery\n\n    },\n    \ndefaultValues\n: {\n      \naggregationMaxSize\n: 1024,\n      \nrawMaxSize\n: 500,\n      \ndurationMaxSecs\n: 86400,\n      \ndistributionNumberOfPoints\n: 11,\n      \ndistributionQuantilePoints\n: \n0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1\n,\n      \ndistributionQuantileStart\n: 0,\n      \ndistributionQuantileEnd\n: 1,\n      \ndistributionQuantileIncrement\n: 0.1,\n      \nwindowEmitFrequencyMinSecs\n: 1,\n      \neveryForRecordBasedWindow\n: 1,\n      \neveryForTimeBasedWindow\n: 2,\n      \nsketches\n: {\n        \ncountDistinctMaxEntries\n: 16384,\n        \ngroupByMaxEntries\n: 512,\n        \ndistributionMaxEntries\n: 1024,\n        \ndistributionMaxNumberOfPoints\n: 200,\n        \ntopKMaxEntries\n: 1024,\n        \ntopKErrorType\n: \nNo False Negatives\n\n      },\n      \nmetadataKeyMapping\n: {\n        \nquerySection\n: \nQuery\n,\n        \nwindowSection\n: \nWindow\n,\n        \nsketchSection\n: \nSketch\n,\n        \ntheta\n: \nTheta\n,\n        \nuniquesEstimate\n: \nUniques Estimate\n,\n        \nqueryCreationTime\n: \nReceive Time\n,\n        \nqueryTerminationTime\n: \nFinish Time\n,\n        \nestimatedResult\n: \nWas Estimated\n,\n        \nstandardDeviations\n: \nStandard Deviations\n,\n        \nnormalizedRankError\n: \nNormalized Rank Error\n,\n        \nmaximumCountError\n: \nMaximum Count Error\n,\n        \nitemsSeen\n: \nItems Seen\n,\n        \nminimumValue\n: \nMinimum Value\n,\n        \nmaximumValue\n: \nMaximum Value\n,\n        \nwindowNumber\n: \nNumber\n,\n        \nwindowSize\n: \nSize\n,\n        \nwindowEmitTime\n: \nEmit Time\n,\n        \nexpectedEmitTime\n: \nExpected Emit Time\n\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nSince we served our schema through the same Web Service as our queries, both these point to our Web Service. Note that there is no \nschemaPath\n because it must be the constant string \ncolumns\n. If you define a custom endpoint for your schema, you must ensure that it can be obtained by making a GET request to \nschemaHost/schemaNamespace/columns\n.",

I thought you said hundreds of thousands of records...  100 records per second is not Big Data by any stretch of the imagination but this Quick Start is running everything on one machine and is meant to introduce you to what Bullet does. In practice, you would scale and run your components with CPU and memory configurations to accommodate for your data volume and querying needs.

This method is wrapped in a thread that is called by the Spark framework. This function only emits at most the given maximum tuples per period.    private def makeRandomMap: Map[java.lang.String, java.lang.String] = {\n    val randomMap = new HashMap[java.lang.String, java.lang.String](2)\n    randomMap.put(RandomReceiver.RANDOM_MAP_KEY_A, RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL(Random.nextInt(RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL.length)))\n    randomMap.put(RandomReceiver.RANDOM_MAP_KEY_B, RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL(Random.nextInt(RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL.length)))\n    randomMap\n  }\n\n  private def generateRecord(): BulletRecord = {\n    val record = new SimpleBulletRecord()\n    val uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString\n    record.setString(RandomReceiver.STRING, uuid)\n    record.setLong(RandomReceiver.LONG, generatedThisPeriod)\n    record.setDouble(RandomReceiver.DOUBLE, Random.nextDouble())\n    record.setDouble(RandomReceiver.GAUSSIAN, Random.nextGaussian())\n    record.setString(RandomReceiver.TYPE, RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL(Random.nextInt(RandomReceiver.STRING_POOL.length)))\n    record.setLong(RandomReceiver.DURATION, System.nanoTime() % RandomReceiver.INTEGER_POOL(Random.nextInt(RandomReceiver.INTEGER_POOL.length)))\n\n    // Don't use Scala Map and convert it by asJava when calling setxxxMap method in BulletRecord.\n    // It converts Scala Map to scala.collection.convert.Wrappers$MapWrapper which is not serializable in scala 2.11.x (https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8911).\n\n    record.setStringMap(RandomReceiver.SUBTYPES_MAP, makeRandomMap);\n\n    val booleanMap = new HashMap[java.lang.String, java.lang.Boolean](4)\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(0, 8), Random.nextBoolean())\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(9, 13), Random.nextBoolean())\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(14, 18), Random.nextBoolean())\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(19, 23), Random.nextBoolean())\n    record.setBooleanMap(RandomReceiver.BOOLEAN_MAP, booleanMap)\n\n\n    val statsMap = new HashMap[java.lang.String, java.lang.Long](4)\n    statsMap.put(RandomReceiver.PERIOD_COUNT, periodCount)\n    statsMap.put(RandomReceiver.RECORD_NUMBER, periodCount * maxPerPeriod + generatedThisPeriod)\n    statsMap.put(RandomReceiver.NANO_TIME, System.nanoTime())\n    statsMap.put(RandomReceiver.TIMESTAMP, System.nanoTime())\n    record.setLongMap(RandomReceiver.STATS_MAP, statsMap)\n\n    record.setListOfStringMap(RandomReceiver.LIST, asList(makeRandomMap, makeRandomMap))\n    record\n  }  This  generateRecord  method generates some fields randomly and inserts them into a BulletRecord (simple).

You can then \ncontinue this guide from here\n.\n\n\n\n\nWant to DIY?\n\n\nIf you want to manually run all the commands or if the script died while doing something above (might want to perform the \nteardown\n first), you can continue below.\n\n\n\n\nManual Installation\n\n\nSetting up Storm\n\n\nTo set up a clean working environment, let's start with creating some directories.\n\n\nStep 1: Setup directories and examples\n\n\nexport BULLET_HOME=$(pwd)/bullet-quickstart\nmkdir -p $BULLET_HOME/backend/storm\nmkdir -p $BULLET_HOME/service\nmkdir -p $BULLET_HOME/ui\ncd $BULLET_HOME\ncurl -LO https://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-db.github.io/releases/download/v0.6.0/examples_artifacts.tar.gz\ntar -xzf examples_artifacts.tar.gz\nexport BULLET_EXAMPLES=$BULLET_HOME/bullet-examples\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Install Storm 1.2\n\n\ncd $BULLET_HOME/backend\ncurl -O http://apache.org/dist/storm/apache-storm-1.2.2/apache-storm-1.2.2.zip\nunzip apache-storm-1.2.2.zip\nexport PATH=$(pwd)/apache-storm-1.2.2/bin/:$PATH\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Launch Storm components\n\n\nLaunch each of the following components, in order and wait for the commands to go through. You may have to do these one at a time. You will see a JVM being launched for each one and connection messages as the components communicate through Zookeeper.\n\n\nstorm dev-zookeeper \n\nstorm nimbus \n\nstorm ui \n\nstorm logviewer \n\nstorm supervisor \n\n\n\n\n\nIt may take 30-60 seconds for all the components to launch.\n\n\nOnce everything is up without errors, visit \nhttp://localhost:8080\n and see if the Storm UI loads.\n\n\n\n\nLocal mode cleanup\n\n\nIf you notice any problems while setting up storm or while relaunching a topology, it may be because some state is corrupted. When running Storm in this fashion, states and serializations are stored in \nstorm-local\n and \n/tmp/\n. You may want to \nrm -rf storm-local/* /tmp/dev-storm-zookeeper\n to clean up this state before relaunching Storm components. See the \ntear down section\n on how to kill any running instances.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up the example Bullet topology\n\n\nNow that Storm is up and running, we can put Bullet on it. We will use an example Spout that runs on Bullet 0.8.3 on our Storm cluster. The source is available \nhere\n. This was part of the artifact that you installed in Step 1.\n\n\nStep 4: Setup the Storm example\n\n\ncp $BULLET_EXAMPLES/backend/storm/* $BULLET_HOME/backend/storm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSettings\n\n\nTake a look at bullet_settings.yaml for the settings that are being overridden for this example. You can add or change settings as you like by referring to \ncore Bullet settings in bullet_defaults.yaml\n and \nStorm settings in bullet_storm_defaults.yaml\n. In particular, we have \ncustomized these settings\n that affect the Bullet queries you can run:\n\n\nbullet.query.aggregation.raw.max.size: 500\n The max \nRAW\n records you can fetch is 500.\n\n\nbullet.query.aggregation.max.size: 1024\n The max records you can fetch for any query is 1024.\n\n\nbullet.query.aggregation.count.distinct.sketch.entries: 16384\n We can count 16384 unique values exactly. Approximates after.\n\n\nbullet.query.aggregation.group.sketch.entries: 1024\n The max unique groups can be 1024. Uniform sample after.\n\n\nbullet.query.aggregation.distribution.sketch.entries: 1024\n Determines the normalized rank error for distributions.\n\n\nbullet.query.aggregation.top.k.sketch.entries: 1024\n 0.75 times this number is the number of unique items for which counts can be done exactly. Approximates after.\n\n\nbullet.query.aggregation.distribution.max.points: 200\n The maximum number of points you can generate, use or provide for a Distribution aggregation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to tweak the example topology code?\n\n\nYou will need to clone the \nexamples repository\n and customize it. To build the examples, you'll need to install \nMaven 3\n.\n\n\ncd $BULLET_HOME \n git clone git@github.com:bullet-db/bullet-db.github.io.git\n\n\ncd bullet-db.github.io/examples/storm \n mvn package\n\n\nYou will find the \nbullet-storm-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar\n in \n$BULLET_HOME/bullet-db.github.io/examples/storm/target/\n\n\nYou can also make the \nexamples_artifacts.tar.gz\n file with all the settings that is placed in \n$BULLET_EXAMPLES\n by just running \nmake\n in the \nbullet-db.github.io/examples/\n folder.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Launch the topology\n\n\ncd $BULLET_HOME/backend/storm \n ./launch.sh\n\n\n\n\nVisit the UI and see if the topology is up. You should see the \nDataSource\n spout begin emitting records.\n\n\n\n\nWhere is this data coming from?\n\n\nThis data is randomly generated by the \ncustom Storm spout\n that is in the example topology you just launched. In practice, your spout would read from an actual data source such as Kafka etc. See \nbelow\n for more details about this random data spout.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up the Bullet Web Service\n\n\nStep 6: Install the Bullet Web Service\n\n\ncd $BULLET_HOME/service\ncurl -Lo bullet-service.jar http://jcenter.bintray.com/com/yahoo/bullet/bullet-service/0.4.3/bullet-service-0.4.3-embedded.jar\ncp $BULLET_EXAMPLES/web-service/example* $BULLET_HOME/service/\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Launch the Web Service\n\n\ncd $BULLET_HOME/service\njava -jar bullet-service.jar --bullet.pubsub.config=example_rest_pubsub_config.yaml --bullet.schema.file=example_columns.json --bullet.pubsub.builtin.rest.enabled=true --server.port=9999  --logging.path=. --logging.file=log.txt \n log.txt \n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we turned on the built-in REST pubsub in the Web Service when launching it. The REST PubSub is bundled into the Bullet API by default, so no additional jars are needed.\n\n\nYou can verify that it is up by running a Bullet query or getting the example columns through the API:\n\n\ncurl -s -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -X POST -d '{\naggregation\n: {\nsize\n: 1}}' http://localhost:9999/api/bullet/sse-query\ncurl -s http://localhost:9999/api/bullet/columns\n\n\n\n\nSetting up the Bullet UI\n\n\nStep 8: Install Node\n\n\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.1/install.sh | bash\nsource ~/.bashrc\nnvm install v6.9.4\nnvm use v6.9.4\n\n\n\n\nStep 9: Install the Bullet UI\n\n\ncd $BULLET_HOME/ui\ncurl -LO https://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-ui/releases/download/src/bullet-ui-v0.6.1.tar.gz\ntar -xzf bullet-ui-v0.6.1.tar.gz\ncp $BULLET_EXAMPLES/ui/env-settings.json config/\n\n\n\n\nStep 10: Launch the UI\n\n\nPORT=8800 node express-server.js \n\n\n\n\n\nVisit \nhttp://localhost:8800\n to query your topology with the UI. See \nUI usage\n for some example queries and interactions using this UI. You see what the Schema means by visiting the Schema section.\n\n\n\n\nRunning it remotely?\n\n\nIf you access the UI from another machine than where your UI is actually running, you will need to edit \nconfig/env-settings.json\n. Since the UI is a client-side app, the machine that your browser is running on will fetch the UI and attempt to use these settings to talk to the Web Service. Since they point to localhost by default, your browser will attempt to connect there and fail. An easy fix is to change \nlocalhost\n in your env-settings.json to point to the host name where you will hosting the UI. This will be the same as the UI host you use in the browser. You can also do a local port forward on the machine accessing the UI by running: \nssh -N -L 8800:localhost:8800 -L 9999:localhost:9999 hostname-of-the-quickstart-components 2\n1\n\n\n\n\nPlaying around with the instance\n\n\nCheck out and follow along with the \nUI Usage\n page as it shows you some queries you can run using this UI.\n\n\nTeardown\n\n\nIf you were using the \nInstall Script\n or if you don't want to manually bring down everything, you can run:\n\n\ncurl -sLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bullet-db/bullet-db.github.io/src/examples/install-all-storm.sh | bash -s cleanup\n\n\n\n\nIf you were performing the steps yourself, you can also manually cleanup \nall the components and all the downloads\n using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUI\n\n\npkill -f [e]xpress-server.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Service\n\n\npkill -f [e]xample_rest_pubsub_config.yaml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorm\n\n\npkill -f [a]pache-storm-1.2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile System\n\n\nrm -rf $BULLET_HOME /tmp/dev-storm-zookeeper /tmp/jetty-*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis does \nnot\n delete \n$HOME/.nvm\n and some extra lines nvm may have added to your \n$HOME/{.profile, .bash_profile, .zshrc, .bashrc}\n.\n\n\nWhat did we do?\n\n\nThis section will go over the various custom pieces this example plugged into Bullet, so you can better understand what we did.\n\n\nStorm topology\n\n\nThe topology was the Bullet topology plugged in with a custom spout. This spout is implemented in this \nexample project\n and was already built for you when you \ndownloaded the examples\n. It does not read from any data source and just produces random, structured data. It also produces only up to a maximum number of records in a given period. Both this maximum and the length of a period are configurable. If you examine $BULLET_HOME/backend/storm/launch.sh, you'll see the following:\n\n\nstorm jar bullet-storm-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \\\n          com.yahoo.bullet.Topology \\\n          --bullet-conf ./bullet_settings.yaml \\\n          --bullet-spout com.yahoo.bullet.storm.examples.RandomSpout \\\n          --bullet-spout-parallelism 1 \\\n          ...\n          --bullet-spout-arg 20 \\\n          --bullet-spout-arg 101 \\\n          ...\n\n\n\n\nThis command launches the jar (an uber or \"fat\" jar) containing the custom spout code and all dependencies you copied in Step 5. We pass the name of your spout class with \n--bullet-spout com.yahoo.bullet.storm.examples.RandomSpout\n to the Bullet main class \ncom.yahoo.bullet.Topology\n with two arguments \n--bullet-spout-arg 20\n and \n--bullet-spout-arg 101\n. The first argument tells the Spout to generate at most 20 tuples (records) in a period and the second argument says a period is 101 ms long.\n\n\nThe settings defined by \n--bullet-conf ./bullet_settings.yaml\n and the arguments here run all components in the topology with a parallelism of 1. So there will be one spout that is producing ~200 rps.\n\n\n\n\nI thought you said hundreds of thousands of records...\n\n\n200 records is not Big Data by any stretch of the imagination but this Quick Start is running everything on one machine and is meant to introduce you to what Bullet does. In practice, you would scale and run your components with CPU and memory configurations to accommodate for your data volume and querying needs.\n\n\n\n\nLet's look at the \ncustom spout code\n that generates the data.\n\n\n    @Override\n    public void nextTuple() {\n        long timeNow = System.nanoTime();\n        // Only emit if we are still in the interval and haven't gone over our per period max\n        if (timeNow \n= nextIntervalStart \n generatedThisPeriod \n maxPerPeriod) {\n            outputCollector.emit(new Values(generateRecord()), DUMMY_ID);\n            generatedThisPeriod++;\n            return;\n        }\n        if (timeNow \n nextIntervalStart) {\n            log.info(\nGenerated {} tuples out of {}\n, generatedThisPeriod, maxPerPeriod);\n            nextIntervalStart = timeNow + period;\n            generatedThisPeriod = 0;\n            periodCount++;\n        }\n        // It is courteous to sleep for a short time if you're not emitting anything...\n        try {\n            Thread.sleep(1);\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            log.error(\nError: \n, e);\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nThis method above emits the tuples. The Storm framework calls this method. This function only emits at most the given maximum tuples per period.\n\n\n\n\nWhy a DUMMY_ID?\n\n\nWhen the spout emits the randomly generated tuple, it attaches a \nDUMMY_ID\n to it. In Storm terms, this is a message ID. By adding a message ID, this tuple can be made to flow reliably. The Bullet component that receives this tuple (Filter bolt) acknowledges or \"acks\" this tuple. If the tuple did not make it to Filter bolt within a configured timeout window, Storm will call a \nfail(Object messageId)\n method on the spout. This particular spout does not define one and hence the usage of a \nDUMMY_ID\n. If your source of data can identify records uniquely and you can re-emit them on a fail, you should attach that actual ID in place of the \nDUMMY_ID\n.\n\n\n\n\nprivate Map\nString, String\n makeRandomMap() {\n    Map\nString, String\n randomMap = new HashMap\n(2);\n    randomMap.put(RANDOM_MAP_KEY_A, STRING_POOL[random.nextInt(STRING_POOL.length)]);\n    randomMap.put(RANDOM_MAP_KEY_B, STRING_POOL[random.nextInt(STRING_POOL.length)]);\n    return randomMap;\n}\n\nprivate BulletRecord generateRecord() {\n    BulletRecord record = new AvroBulletRecord();\n    String uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();\n\n    record.setString(STRING, uuid);\n    record.setLong(LONG, (long) generatedThisPeriod);\n    record.setDouble(DOUBLE, random.nextDouble());\n    record.setDouble(GAUSSIAN, random.nextGaussian());\n    record.setString(TYPE, STRING_POOL[random.nextInt(STRING_POOL.length)]);\n    record.setLong(DURATION, System.currentTimeMillis() % INTEGER_POOL[random.nextInt(INTEGER_POOL.length)]);\n\n    record.setStringMap(SUBTYPES_MAP, makeRandomMap());\n\n    Map\nString, Boolean\n booleanMap = new HashMap\n(4);\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(0, 8), random.nextBoolean());\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(9, 13), random.nextBoolean());\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(14, 18), random.nextBoolean());\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(19, 23), random.nextBoolean());\n    record.setBooleanMap(BOOLEAN_MAP, booleanMap);\n\n    Map\nString, Long\n statsMap = new HashMap\n(4);\n    statsMap.put(PERIOD_COUNT, periodCount);\n    statsMap.put(RECORD_NUMBER, periodCount * maxPerPeriod + generatedThisPeriod);\n    statsMap.put(NANO_TIME, System.nanoTime());\n    statsMap.put(TIMESTAMP, System.currentTimeMillis());\n    record.setLongMap(STATS_MAP, statsMap);\n\n    record.setListOfStringMap(LIST, asList(makeRandomMap(), makeRandomMap()));\n\n    return record;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis \ngenerateRecord\n method generates some fields randomly and inserts them into a BulletRecord. Note that the BulletRecord is typed and all data must be inserted with the proper types.\n\n\nIf you put Bullet on your data, you will need to write a Spout (or a topology if your reading is complex), that reads from your data source and emits BulletRecords with the fields you wish to be query-able placed into a BulletRecord similar to this example.\n\n\nPubSub\n\n\nWe used the \nREST PubSub\n. Note that even though we support a DRPC PubSub, it doesn't actually support windowing so we have not used it for this example. We configured the Backend to use this PubSub by adding these settings to the YAML file that we passed to our Storm topology. Notice that we set the context to \nQUERY_PROCESSING\n since this is the Backend. We do not set \nbullet.pubsub.rest.result.url\n because each query sent to the topology has this information so that the results could be returned back to it.\n\n\nbullet.pubsub.context.name: \nQUERY_PROCESSING\n\nbullet.pubsub.class.name: \ncom.yahoo.bullet.pubsub.rest.RESTPubSub\n\nbullet.pubsub.rest.query.urls:\n    - \nhttp://localhost:9999/api/bullet/pubsub/query\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Web Service, we passed in a YAML file that pointed to itself for the REST endpoints that serve as the PubSub interface. Notice that we set the context to \nQUERY_SUBMISSION\n since this is the Web Service.\n\n\nbullet.pubsub.context.name: \nQUERY_SUBMISSION\n\nbullet.pubsub.class.name: \ncom.yahoo.bullet.pubsub.rest.RESTPubSub\n\nbullet.pubsub.rest.query.urls:\n    - \nhttp://localhost:9999/api/bullet/pubsub/query\n\nbullet.pubsub.rest.result.url: \nhttp://localhost:9999/api/bullet/pubsub/result\n\nbullet.pubsub.rest.subscriber.connect.timeout.ms: 5000\nbullet.pubsub.rest.publisher.connect.timeout.ms: 5000\nbullet.pubsub.rest.subscriber.max.uncommitted.messages: 100\nbullet.pubsub.rest.result.subscriber.min.wait.ms: 10\nbullet.pubsub.rest.query.subscriber.min.wait.ms: 10\n\n\n\n\nWeb Service\n\n\nWe launched the Web Service using two custom files - a PubSub configuration YAML file and JSON schema file.\n\n\nThe JSON columns file contains the schema for our data specified in JSON. Since our schema is not going to change, we use the Web Service to serve it from a file. If your schema changes dynamically, you will need to provide your own endpoint to the UI.\n\n\nThe following is a snippet from the \nJSON file\n. Notice how the types of the fields are specified. Also, if you have generated BulletRecord with Map fields whose keys are known, you can specify them here using \nenumerations\n.\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \nname\n: \nprobability\n,\n        \ntype\n: \nDOUBLE\n,\n        \ndescription\n: \nGenerated from Random#nextDouble\n\n    },\n    ...\n    {\n        \nname\n: \nstats_map\n,\n        \ntype\n: \nMAP\n,\n        \nsubtype\n: \nLONG\n,\n        \ndescription\n: \nThis map contains some numeric information such as the current number of periods etc.\n,\n        \nenumerations\n: [\n            ...\n            {\nname\n: \nnano_time\n, \ndescription\n: \nThe ns time when this record was generated\n}\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \nname\n: \nclassifiers\n,\n        \ntype\n: \nLIST\n,\n        \nsubtype\n: \nMAP\n,\n        \ndescription\n: \nThis contains two maps, each with: field_A and field_B whose values are randomly chosen from: foo, bar, baz, qux, quux, norf\n\n    }\n]\n\n\n\n\nThe contents of the \nPubSub configuration file\n was discussed in the \nPubSub section above\n.\n\n\nUI\n\n\nFinally, we configured the UI with the custom environment specific settings file. We did not add any environments since we only had the one.\n\n\n{\n  \ndefault\n: {\n    \nqueryHost\n: \nhttp://localhost:9999\n,\n    \nqueryNamespace\n: \napi/bullet\n,\n    \nqueryPath\n: \nws-query\n,\n    \nqueryStompRequestChannel\n: \n/server/request\n,\n    \nqueryStompResponseChannel\n: \n/client/response\n,\n    \nschemaHost\n: \nhttp://localhost:9999\n,\n    \nschemaNamespace\n: \napi/bullet\n,\n    \nhelpLinks\n: [\n      {\n        \nname\n: \nTutorials\n,\n        \nlink\n: \nhttps://bullet-db.github.io/ui/usage\n\n      }\n    ],\n    \nbugLink\n: \nhttps://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-ui/issues\n,\n    \nmodelVersion\n: 3,\n    \nmigrations\n: {\n      \ndeletions\n: \nquery\n\n    },\n    \ndefaultValues\n: {\n      \naggregationMaxSize\n: 1024,\n      \nrawMaxSize\n: 500,\n      \ndurationMaxSecs\n: 86400,\n      \ndistributionNumberOfPoints\n: 11,\n      \ndistributionQuantilePoints\n: \n0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1\n,\n      \ndistributionQuantileStart\n: 0,\n      \ndistributionQuantileEnd\n: 1,\n      \ndistributionQuantileIncrement\n: 0.1,\n      \nwindowEmitFrequencyMinSecs\n: 1,\n      \neveryForRecordBasedWindow\n: 1,\n      \neveryForTimeBasedWindow\n: 2,\n      \nsketches\n: {\n        \ncountDistinctMaxEntries\n: 16384,\n        \ngroupByMaxEntries\n: 512,\n        \ndistributionMaxEntries\n: 1024,\n        \ndistributionMaxNumberOfPoints\n: 200,\n        \ntopKMaxEntries\n: 1024,\n        \ntopKErrorType\n: \nNo False Negatives\n\n      },\n      \nmetadataKeyMapping\n: {\n        \nquerySection\n: \nQuery\n,\n        \nwindowSection\n: \nWindow\n,\n        \nsketchSection\n: \nSketch\n,\n        \ntheta\n: \nTheta\n,\n        \nuniquesEstimate\n: \nUniques Estimate\n,\n        \nqueryCreationTime\n: \nReceive Time\n,\n        \nqueryTerminationTime\n: \nFinish Time\n,\n        \nestimatedResult\n: \nWas Estimated\n,\n        \nstandardDeviations\n: \nStandard Deviations\n,\n        \nnormalizedRankError\n: \nNormalized Rank Error\n,\n        \nmaximumCountError\n: \nMaximum Count Error\n,\n        \nitemsSeen\n: \nItems Seen\n,\n        \nminimumValue\n: \nMinimum Value\n,\n        \nmaximumValue\n: \nMaximum Value\n,\n        \nwindowNumber\n: \nNumber\n,\n        \nwindowSize\n: \nSize\n,\n        \nwindowEmitTime\n: \nEmit Time\n,\n        \nexpectedEmitTime\n: \nExpected Emit Time\n\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nSince we served our schema through the same Web Service as our queries, both these point to our Web Service.

This spout is implemented in this  example project  and was already built for you when you  downloaded the examples . It does not read from any data source and just produces random, structured data. It also produces only up to a maximum number of records in a given period. Both this maximum and the length of a period are configurable. If you examine $BULLET_HOME/backend/storm/launch.sh, you'll see the following:  storm jar bullet-storm-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \\\n          com.yahoo.bullet.Topology \\\n          --bullet-conf ./bullet_settings.yaml \\\n          --bullet-spout com.yahoo.bullet.storm.examples.RandomSpout \\\n          --bullet-spout-parallelism 1 \\\n          ...\n          --bullet-spout-arg 20 \\\n          --bullet-spout-arg 101 \\\n          ...  This command launches the jar (an uber or \"fat\" jar) containing the custom spout code and all dependencies you copied in Step 5. We pass the name of your spout class with  --bullet-spout com.yahoo.bullet.storm.examples.RandomSpout  to the Bullet main class  com.yahoo.bullet.Topology  with two arguments  --bullet-spout-arg 20  and  --bullet-spout-arg 101 . The first argument tells the Spout to generate at most 20 tuples (records) in a period and the second argument says a period is 101 ms long.  The settings defined by  --bullet-conf ./bullet_settings.yaml  and the arguments here run all components in the topology with a parallelism of 1. So there will be one spout that is producing ~200 rps.   I thought you said hundreds of thousands of records...  200 records is not Big Data by any stretch of the imagination but this Quick Start is running everything on one machine and is meant to introduce you to what Bullet does. In practice, you would scale and run your components with CPU and memory configurations to accommodate for your data volume and querying needs.   Let's look at the  custom spout code  that generates the data.      @Override\n    public void nextTuple() {\n        long timeNow = System.nanoTime();\n        // Only emit if we are still in the interval and haven't gone over our per period max\n        if (timeNow  = nextIntervalStart   generatedThisPeriod   maxPerPeriod) {\n            outputCollector.emit(new Values(generateRecord()), DUMMY_ID);\n            generatedThisPeriod++;\n            return;\n        }\n        if (timeNow   nextIntervalStart) {\n            log.info( Generated {} tuples out of {} , generatedThisPeriod, maxPerPeriod);\n            nextIntervalStart = timeNow + period;\n            generatedThisPeriod = 0;\n            periodCount++;\n        }\n        // It is courteous to sleep for a short time if you're not emitting anything...\n        try {\n            Thread.sleep(1);\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            log.error( Error:  , e);\n        }\n    }  This method above emits the tuples. The Storm framework calls this method. This function only emits at most the given maximum tuples per period.   Why a DUMMY_ID?  When the spout emits the randomly generated tuple, it attaches a  DUMMY_ID  to it. In Storm terms, this is a message ID. By adding a message ID, this tuple can be made to flow reliably. The Bullet component that receives this tuple (Filter bolt) acknowledges or \"acks\" this tuple. If the tuple did not make it to Filter bolt within a configured timeout window, Storm will call a  fail(Object messageId)  method on the spout. This particular spout does not define one and hence the usage of a  DUMMY_ID . If your source of data can identify records uniquely and you can re-emit them on a fail, you should attach that actual ID in place of the  DUMMY_ID .   private Map String, String  makeRandomMap() {\n    Map String, String  randomMap = new HashMap (2);\n    randomMap.put(RANDOM_MAP_KEY_A, STRING_POOL[random.nextInt(STRING_POOL.length)]);\n    randomMap.put(RANDOM_MAP_KEY_B, STRING_POOL[random.nextInt(STRING_POOL.length)]);\n    return randomMap;\n}\n\nprivate BulletRecord generateRecord() {\n    BulletRecord record = new AvroBulletRecord();\n    String uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();\n\n    record.setString(STRING, uuid);\n    record.setLong(LONG, (long) generatedThisPeriod);\n    record.setDouble(DOUBLE, random.nextDouble());\n    record.setDouble(GAUSSIAN, random.nextGaussian());\n    record.setString(TYPE, STRING_POOL[random.nextInt(STRING_POOL.length)]);\n    record.setLong(DURATION, System.currentTimeMillis() % INTEGER_POOL[random.nextInt(INTEGER_POOL.length)]);\n\n    record.setStringMap(SUBTYPES_MAP, makeRandomMap());\n\n    Map String, Boolean  booleanMap = new HashMap (4);\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(0, 8), random.nextBoolean());\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(9, 13), random.nextBoolean());\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(14, 18), random.nextBoolean());\n    booleanMap.put(uuid.substring(19, 23), random.nextBoolean());\n    record.setBooleanMap(BOOLEAN_MAP, booleanMap);\n\n    Map String, Long  statsMap = new HashMap (4);\n    statsMap.put(PERIOD_COUNT, periodCount);\n    statsMap.put(RECORD_NUMBER, periodCount * maxPerPeriod + generatedThisPeriod);\n    statsMap.put(NANO_TIME, System.nanoTime());\n    statsMap.put(TIMESTAMP, System.currentTimeMillis());\n    record.setLongMap(STATS_MAP, statsMap);\n\n    record.setListOfStringMap(LIST, asList(makeRandomMap(), makeRandomMap()));\n\n    return record;\n}  This  generateRecord  method generates some fields randomly and inserts them into a BulletRecord. Note that the BulletRecord is typed and all data must be inserted with the proper types.  If you put Bullet on your data, you will need to write a Spout (or a topology if your reading is complex), that reads from your data source and emits BulletRecords with the fields you wish to be query-able placed into a BulletRecord similar to this example.",

            "text": "Storm architecture\n\n\nThis section describes how the \nBackend architecture\n is implemented in Storm.\n\n\nTopology\n\n\nFor Bullet on Storm, the Storm topology implements the backend piece from the full \nArchitecture\n. The topology is implemented with the standard Storm spout and bolt components:\n\n\n\n\nThe components in \nArchitecture\n have direct counterparts here. The Query spouts reading from the PubSub layer using plugged-in PubSub consumers make up the Request Processor. The Filter bolts and your plugin for your source of data (generally a spout but could be a topology) make up the Data Processor. The Join bolt, the Loop bolt and the Result bolt make up the Combiner.\n\n\nThe red colored lines are the path for the queries that come in through the PubSub, the blue is for the data from your data source and the orange is for metadata and loop-back signals used internally by the backend. The pattern on the lines denote how the data (Storm tuples) is moved to the next component. Dashed indicates a broadcast (sent to all instances of the component), dotted indicates a key grouping (sent to a particular instance based on hashing on a particular field), and solid indicates a shuffle (randomly sent to an instance).\n\n\n\n\nWhat's a Tick Spout?\n\n\nThe Tick Spout component produces Storm tuples at predefined intervals to the Filter and Join Bolts. These tuples, called tick tuples, behave like CPU clock cycles for Bullet. Bullet performs all its system related activities on a tick. This includes purging stale queries, emitting left over data for queries, etc. We could have gone the route of having asynchronous threads that do the same thing but this was a far more simpler solution. The downside is that Bullet is as fast or as slow as its tick period, which can be configured on launch (defaults to \n100 ms\n). In practice, this means that your time-based windows need to be at least twice as long as your tick period.\n\n\nAs a practical example of how Bullet uses ticks: when the final data is emitted from the Filter bolts when the query has expired, the Join bolt receiving it waits for 3 (this is configurable) ticks after \nits query\n expires to collect all the last intermediate results from the Filter bolts. If the tick period is set as high as 5 s, this means that a query will take 3 * 15 or 15 s to get back after its expiry! Setting it to 1 s, makes it 1 * 3 s. Similarly, intermediate windows are buffered (for certain kinds of windowed queries) to collect all results for that window before sending it back to the user.\n\n\n\n\nData processing\n\n\nBullet can accept arbitrary sources of data as long as they can be read from Storm. You can either:\n\n\n\n\nWrite a Storm spout that reads your data from where ever it is (Kafka etc) and \nconverts it to Bullet Records\n. See \nQuick Start\n for an example.\n\n\nHook up an existing topology that is doing something else directly to Bullet. You will still write and hook up a component that converts your data into Bullet Records in your existing topology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 1\n\n\nVery simple to get started. Just implement a spout\n\n\nNeed a storage layer that your spout pulls or some system has to push to your spouts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2\n\n\nSaves a persistence layer\n\n\nTies your topology to Bullet directly, making it affected by Storm Backpressure etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2\n\n\nYou can add bolts to do more processing on your data before sending it to Bullet\n\n\nIncreases the complexity of the topology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour data is then emitted to the Filter bolt.  If you have no queries in your system, the Filter bolt will promptly drop all Bullet Records and do absolutely nothing. If there are queries in the Filter bolt, the record is checked against the \nfilters\n in each query and if it matches, it is processed by the query. Each query type can choose when to emit based on what window is configured for it. Depending on this, the matched record could be immediately emitted (if it is a RAW query or the intermediate aggregate if anything else) or it could be buffered till a specific time is reached (or the query has expired).\n\n\nRequest processing\n\n\nThe Query spouts fetch Bullet queries through the PubSub layer using the Subscribers provided by the plugged in PubSub layer. The queries received through the PubSub also contain information about the query such as its unique identifier and potentially other metadata. The Query spouts broadcasts the query body to every Filter bolt. Since every Filter bolt has a copy of every query, the shuffled data from the source of data can be compared against the query no matter which particular Filter bolt it ends up at. Each Filter bolt has access to the unique query id and is able to key group by the id to the Join bolt with the intermediate results for the query.\n\n\nThe Query spout also key groups the query and additional query metadata to the Join bolts. This means that the query and the metadata will be end up at exactly one Join bolt.\n\n\nCombining\n\n\nSince the data from the Query spout (query and metadata) and the data from all Filter bolts (intermediate results) is key grouped by the unique query id, only one particular Join bolt receives both the query and the intermediate results for a particular query. The Join bolt can then combine the intermediate results and produce a final result. This result is joined (hence the name) along with the metadata for the query and is shuffled to the Result bolts. This bolt then uses the particular Publisher from the plugged in PubSub layer and uses the metadata if it needs to and sends the results back through the PubSub layer to the requestor.\n\n\n\n\nCombining and operations\n\n\nIn order to be able to combine intermediate results and process data in any order, all aggregations that Bullet does need to be associative and have an identity. In other words, they need to be \nMonoids\n. Luckily for us, the \nDataSketches\n that we use are monoids when exact (\nCOUNT DISTINCT\n and \nGROUP BY\n actually are commutative monoids). Sketches can be unioned and thus all the aggregations we support - \nSUM\n, \nCOUNT\n, \nMIN\n, \nMAX\n, \nAVG\n, \nCOUNT DISTINCT\n, \nDISTINCT\n etc - are monoidal. (\nAVG\n is monoidal if you store a \nSUM\n and a \nCOUNT\n instead). When \nDISTRIBUTION\n and \nTOP K\n Sketches are approximating, they may end up not being associative since they depend on the distribution of the data but you can think of them this way if you include their defined error functions bounding the result of the operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop back\n\n\nWe have not mentioned the loop components. These are mainly used to perform house-keeping within the topology. For instance, there is a Rate Limit concept in the Bullet core libraries that if violated in any instance of the query being executed, should cause the query to be killed. Wherever this error originates, it will trickle to the Loop bolt and be looped back through the PubSub, through the Query Spout and sent to all components that know about the query. These components will then kill the query as well. We call this a loop because strictly speaking, the topology is a Directed Acyclic Graph and we violate it by making a loop. These are also used to deliver external signals such as killing a query etc from the API or the UI. If you disable windows entirely, the Loop bolt will not be wired up when you launch your Bullet topology.\n\n\n\n\nScalability\n\n\nThe topology set up this way scales horizontally and has some nice properties:\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to scale for processing more data but the same amount of queries, you only need to scale the components that read your data (the spout reading the data or your custom topology) and the Filter bolts.\n\n\nIf you want to scale for more queries but the same amount of data, you generally need to scale up the Filter Bolts. If you need it, you can scale the Query spouts, Join bolts, Loop bolts and Result bolts. You should ensure that your PubSub layer (if you're using the Storm DRPC PubSub layer, then this is the number of DRPC servers in your Storm cluster) can handle the volume of queries and results being sent through it. These components generally have low parallelisms compared to your data processing components since the data volume is generally much higher than your query volume, so this is generally not needed.\n\n\n\n\nSee \nScaling for more Queries\n and \nScaling for more Data\n for more details.\n\n\n\n\nMore queries and Filter bolts\n\n\nIf you send more queries to the Filter bolt, it will be limited by at most how many queries a Filter bolt can store and still process data efficiently. Factors like CPU, memory allocations etc for the Filter bolts come in to the picture in addition to the parallelism. Generally, if you have allocated enough Filter bolts to process your data with enough head room, this should let you run hundreds of queries simultaneously before you run into these issues. In practice, since most usage is expected to be on large data volumes and 100s of queries simultaneously, you will need to scale the the Filter bolts out so that they are not slowed down by the large number of queries in each.",

You can find out what these settings do in the comments listed in the defaults.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nTo use Bullet, you need to implement a way to read from your data source and convert your data into Bullet Records (bullet-record is a transitive dependency for Bullet and can be found \nin JCenter\n. You have two options in how to get your data into Bullet:\n\n\n\n\nYou can implement a Spout that reads from your data source and emits Bullet Record.

The submit method can be found in \nTopology.java\n. The submit method submits the topology so it should be the last thing you do in your main.\n\n\nIf you are just implementing a Spout, see the \nLaunch\n section below on how to use the main class in Bullet to create and submit your topology.\n\n\nStorm topologies are generally launched with \"fat\" jars (jar-with-dependencies), excluding storm itself:\n\n\nplugin\n\n    \ngroupId\norg.apache.maven.plugins\n/groupId\n\n    \nartifactId\nmaven-assembly-plugin\n/artifactId\n\n    \nversion\n2.4\n/version\n\n    \nexecutions\n\n        \nexecution\n\n            \nid\nassemble-all\n/id\n\n            \nphase\npackage\n/phase\n\n            \ngoals\n\n                \ngoal\nsingle\n/goal\n\n            \n/goals\n\n        \n/execution\n\n    \n/executions\n\n    \nconfiguration\n\n        \ndescriptorRefs\n\n            \ndescriptorRef\njar-with-dependencies\n/descriptorRef\n\n        \n/descriptorRefs\n\n    \n/configuration\n\n\n/plugin\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder Storm Versions\n\n\nSince package prefixes changed from \nbacktype.storm\n to \norg.apache.storm\n in Storm 1.0 and above, you will need to get the storm-0.10 version of Bullet if\nyour Storm cluster is still not at 1.0 or higher.

The settings that set the CPU and memory loads do not exist (so the config file does not specify them). The setting to enable the topology scheduler are no longer present (you can still override these settings if you run a custom version of Storm by passing it to the storm jar command. \nSee below\n.) You can take a look the settings file on the storm-0.10 branch in the Git repo.\n\n\nIf for some reason, you are running a version of Storm less than 1.0 that has the RAS back-ported to it and you wish to set the CPU and other settings, you will your own main class that mirrors the master branch of the main class but with backtype.storm packages instead.\n\n\nLaunch\n\n\nIf you have implemented your own main class (option 2 above), you just pass your main class to the storm executable as usual. If you are implementing a spout, here's an example of how you could launch the topology:\n\n\nstorm jar your-fat-jar-with-dependencies.jar \\\n          com.yahoo.bullet.Topology \\\n          --bullet-conf path/to/the/bullet_settings.yaml \\\n          --bullet-spout full.package.prefix.to.your.spout.implementation \\\n          --bullet-spout-parallelism 64 \\\n          --bullet-spout-cpu-load 200.0 \\\n          --bullet-spout-on-heap-memory-load 512.0 \\\n          --bullet-spout-off-heap-memory-load 256.0 \\\n          --bullet-spout-arg arg-to-your-spout-class-for-ex-a-path-to-a-config-file \\\n          --bullet-spout-arg another-arg-to-your-spout-class \\\n          -c topology.acker.executors=64 \\\n          -c topology.max.spout.pending=10000\n\n\n\n\nYou can pass other arguments to Storm using the -c argument. The example above uses 64 ackers, for example and uses Storm's \nreliable message processing mechanisms\n. Certain components in the Bullet Storm topology cannot be reliable due to how Bullet operates currently. Hundreds of millions of Storm tuples could go into any query running in Bullet and it is intractable to \nanchor\n a single Bullet aggregation to those tuples, particularly when the results are approximate. However, you should enable acking to ensure at least once message deliveries for the hop from your topology (or spout) to the Filter bolts and for the Query spouts to the Filter and Join bolts. Ackers are lightweight so you need not have the same number of tasks as components that ack in your topology so you can tweak it accordingly. The example above also sets max spout pending to control how fast the spout emits. You could use the back-pressure mechanisms in Storm in addition or in lieu of as you choose. We have found that max spout pending gives a much more predictable way of throttling our spouts during catch up or data spikes.\n\n\n\n\nMain Class Arguments\n\n\nIf you run the main class without arguments or pass in the \n--help\n argument, you can see what these arguments mean and what others are supported.",

            "text": "Tuning and Performance of Bullet in Storm\n\n\nThe performance of a Bullet instance running on a multi-tenant Storm cluster has a lot of independent variables that we could vary and have an effect including:\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of data we consume\n\n\nThe number of simultaneous queries Bullet runs\n\n\nThe kinds of simultaneous queries - \nRAW\n, \nGROUP\n, \nCOUNT DISTINCT\n, etc.\n\n\nVarying parallelisms of the components - increase the parallelisms of Filter bolts disproportionately to others\n\n\nThe hardware configuration of machines\n\n\nThe various Storm versions\n\n\nHow free the cluster is and the kinds of topologies running on the cluster - CPU heavy, Disk/memory heavy, network heavy etc\n\n\nThe source of the data and tuning consumption from it\n\n\n\n\n...and many more.\n\n\nAs a streaming system, the two main features to measure is how much data it operates on and how many queries can you run simultaneously (1 and 2 above). For these results, see [performance][../performance.md]. This section will deal with determining what these are and how they vary. We will focus on 1 and 2, while keeping the others as fixed as possible. This section is to give you some insight as to what to tune to improve performance. This is not meant to be a rigorous benchmark.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nYou should be familiar with \nStorm\n, \nKafka\n and the \nBullet on Storm architecture\n.\n\n\nHow was this tested?\n\n\nAll tests run here were using \nBullet-Storm 0.4.2\n and \nBullet-Storm 0.4.3\n. We are working with just the Storm piece without going through the Web Service or the UI. The DRPC REST endpoint provided by Storm lets us do just that.\n\n\nThis particular version of Bullet on Storm was \nprior to the architecture shift\n to a PubSub layer but this would be the equivalent to using the Storm DRPC PubSub layer on a newer version of Bullet on Storm. You can replace DRPC spout and PrepareRequest bolt with Query spout and ReturnResults bolt with Result bolt conceptually. The actual implementation of the DRPC based PubSub layer just uses these spout and bolt implementations underneath anyway for the Publishers and Subscribers so the parallelisms and CPU utilizations should map 1-1.\n\n\nUsing the pluggable metrics interface in Bullet on Storm, we captured worker level metrics such as CPU time, Heap usage, GC times and types, sent them to a in-house monitoring service for time-slicing and graphing. The figures shown below use this service.\n\n\nSee \n0.3.0\n for how to plug in your own metrics collection.\n\n\nTools used\n\n\n\n\njq\n - a nice tool to parse Bullet JSON responses\n\n\ncurl, bash and python - for running and analyzing Bullet queries\n\n\n\n\nCluster\n\n\n\n\nRunning a custom build of Storm - Storm 0.10.2 with Storm 1.0+ features backported. For all intents and purposes, it's Storm 1.0.3\n\n\nThe spec for the machines we were running on:\n\n\n2 x Intel E5-2680v3 (12 core, 24 threads) - One reserved core gives each machine 47 cores from the Storm scheduler point of view\n\n\n256 GB RAM\n\n\n4 TB SATA Disk\n\n\n10 G Network Interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-tenant cluster with other topologies running. Average cluster utilization ranged from \n70% - 90%\n\n\nThe DRPC servers in the cluster:\n\n\n2 x Intel E5620 (4 cores, 8 Threads) - 16 cores\n\n\n24 GB RAM\n\n\n1 TB SATA Disk\n\n\n10 G Network Interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\nOur data was read from a Kafka cluster. We test with both Kafka 0.9.0.1 and 0.10.0.1\n\n\nThe Kafka cluster was located within the same datacenter as the Storm cluster - close network proximity gives us some measure of confidence that large data transmission delays aren't a factor.\n\n\nThe data volume can be measured by measuring how many individual records are being produced per second and what the size of the data throughput is per second.\n\n\nThere is variance in the volume of data over time as this is real data. For each of the tests below, the data volume at that time will be provided in this format: \nData: XX R/s and XX MiB/s\n, where each of the numbers are the average for each metric over the hour of when the test was done. \nR/s\n is \nRecords per second\n and \nMiB/s\n is \nMebiBytes per second\n. The data is compressed with a compression ratio of \n1.2\n.\n\n\nOur data schema contained \n92\n fields with \n62\n Strings, \n4\n Longs, \n23\n Maps and \n3\n Lists of Maps. Most of the data is generally present in the Maps and Lists of Maps.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nHere is the default configuration we used to launch instances of Bullet.\n\n\nbullet.topology.metrics.enable: true\nbullet.topology.metrics.built.in.enable: true\nbullet.topology.metrics.built.in.emit.interval.mapping:\n   bullet_active_queries: 5\n   default: 60\nbullet.topology.metrics.classes:\n  - \npackage.containing.our.custom.class.pushing.metrics\n\nbullet.topology.tick.interval.secs: 1\nbullet.query.default.duration: 30000\nbullet.query.max.duration: 540000\nbullet.query.aggregation.max.size: 512\nbullet.query.aggregation.raw.max.size: 500\nbullet.query.aggregation.distribution.max.points: 200\n\n\n\n\nAny setting not listed here defaults to the defaults in \nbullet_defaults.yaml\n.

What this certain number is, we will determine below.\n\n\nThe topology was also launched (command-line args to Storm) with the following Storm settings:\n\n\nstorm jar\n    ...\n    --bullet-spout-parallelism 64\n    --bullet-spout-cpu-load 100.0 \\\n    --bullet-spout-on-heap-memory-load 768.0 \\\n    --bullet-spout-off-heap-memory-load 192.0 \\\n    -c topology.acker.executors=256 \\\n    -c topology.max.spout.pending=20000 \\\n    -c topology.backpressure.enable=false \\\n    -c topology.worker.max.heap.size.mb=4096.0 \\\n    -c topology.worker.gc.childopts=\n-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:NewSize=128m -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=70 -XX:-CMSConcurrentMTEnabled -XX:NewRatio=1\n \\\n    ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spout parallelism is 64 because it is going to read from a Kafka topic with 64 partitions (any more is meaningless since it cannot be split further). It reads and converts the data into Bullet Records.\n\n\nWe've fanned out from the spouts to the Filter Bolts by a ratio of 2. We may or may not need this.\n\n\nWe use \ntopology.max.spout.pending=20000\n to limit the number of in-flight tuples there can be from a DataSource Spout instance and throttle it if too many queries are slowing down processing downstream. This is set pretty high to account for catch-up and skew in our Kafka partitions\n\n\nWe have set the max heap size for a worker to \n4 GiB\n since we do not want too large of a worker. If a component dies or a worker is killed by RAS, it will not affect too many other components. It also makes heap dumps etc manageable.\n\n\nWe set \ntopology.worker.gc.childopts\n to use \nParNewGC\n and \nCMS\n. These are our cluster defaults but we are listing them here since this may not be true for all Storm clusters. We have also added the \n-XX:NewRatio=1\n to the defaults since most of our objects are short-lived and having a larger Young Generation reduces our Young Generation GC (ParNew) frequency.\n\n\nWe are using 256 acker tasks. There is acking from the DataSource Spout to the Filter Bolt and from the DRPCSpout and the PrepareRequestBolt, so about ~130 components will be acking. We could get away with using much less ackers as they are very light-weight.\n\n\n\n\nTest 1: Measuring the minimum latency of Bullet\n\n\nWe are \nrunning this query\n in this test. This \nRAW\n query without any filters will serve to measure the intrinsic delay added by Bullet. The data record pulled out has a timestamp for when the record was emitted into Kafka, Bullet will inject the timestamp into the record when the Filter Bolt sends it on and the metadata collection logs timestamps for when the query was received and terminated. Using these, we can measure the end-to-end latency for getting one record through Bullet.\n\n\nResult\n\n\nThe following table shows the timestamps averaged by running \n100\n of these queries. The delays below are shown \nrelative\n to the Query Received timestamp (when the query was received by Bullet at the Join Bolt).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimestamp\n\n\nDelay (ms)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKafka Received\n\n\n-710.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBullet Filtered\n\n\n-2.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery Received\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery Finished\n\n\n1.66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bullet Filtered timestamp above is negative because the Filter Bolt received the query and emitted an arbitrary record \n2.16 ms\n before the Join Bolt received the query. The data was submitted into Kafka about \n710.75 ms\n before the query was received by Bullet and that difference is the processing time of Kafka and the time for our spouts to read the data into Bullet.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nBullet adds a delay of a few ms - \n1.66 ms\n in the test above - to just pull out a record. This result shows that this is the fastest Bullet can be. It cannot return data any faster than this for meaningful queries.\n\n\nTest 2: Measuring the time to find a record\n\n\nThe \nlast test\n attempted to measure how long Bullet takes to pick out a record. Here we will measure how long it takes to find a record \nthat we generate\n. This is the average of running \n100\n queries across a time interval of 30 minutes trying to filter for a record with a single unique value in a field \nsimilar to this query\n.\n\n\nWe added a timestamp into the record when the record was initially read by the DataSource Spout. Using this and the Bullet Filtered timestamp and Query Finished timestamps, we can easily track the record through Bullet.\n\n\nSince we are looking at values in the data, the average data volume across this test was: \nData: 76,000 R/s and 101 MiB/s\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimestamp\n\n\nDelay (ms)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKafka Received\n\n\n445.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBullet Received\n\n\n996.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBullet Filtered\n\n\n1003.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery Received\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery Finished\n\n\n1006.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe record was emitted into Kafka \n445.81 ms\n after the query was received. The delay is the time it takes for the generated record to flow through our network and into Kafka.\n\n\nBullet received the record \n996.5 ms\n after the query was received. The delay from when Kafka received the record to Bullet received is the delay for Kafka to make the record available for reading.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nWe see that Bullet took on average \n1006.8 ms - 996.5 ms\n or \n10.3 ms\n from the time it saw the record first in DataSource Spout to finishing up the query and returning it in the Join Bolt.\n\n\nTest 3: Measuring the maximum number of parallel \nRAW\n queries\n\n\nThis test runs a query similar to the \nsimple filtering query\n. The query looks for \n10\n records that match the filter or runs for \n30\n seconds, whichever comes first. The average, uncompressed record size was about \n1.8 KiB\n.\n\n\nWhat is meant by maximum?\n\n\nWe want to see how many of these queries we can have running simultaneously till the Filter Bolt is unable to process records from the spouts in time. If a Filter Bolt is unable to keep up with the rate of data produced by the spouts, our queries will not find all 10 records. Workers may start dying (killed by RAS for exceeding capacity) as well. We will be trying to find the number of queries in parallel that we can run without these happening.\n\n\nThe average data volume across this test was: \nData: 85,000 R/s and 126 MiB/s\n\n\nQuery\n\n\n{\n \nfilters\n : [\n              {\nfield\n : \nid\n, \noperation\n : \n==\n, \nvalues\n: [\nc39ba8cfe8\n]}\n             ],\n \naggregation\n : {\ntype\n : \nLIMIT\n, \nsize\n : 10},\n \nduration\n : 30000\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe will run a certain number of these queries then generate records matching this query. We will validate that we have all 10 records for all queries at the end.\n\n\nWe ran a number of queries in parallel (you may have to use \nulimit\n to change maximum user processes if you specify a large number), then generated data for the queries (the same data) and waited till the results came back. We then used jq to validate that all generated data was present. In a later test, we will actually measure the latency increase caused by increasing the queries.\n\n\n\n\nIt generates a provided number of the \nquery above\n and runs them in parallel against a randomly chosen DRPC server\n\n\nIt generates data for the query\n\n\nIt waits out the rest of the time and uses jq to validate that all the generated data was found\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nWe were able to run 200 queries successfully but 300 and higher started causing our Filter Bolts to slow down. This slow down caused our spouts to be throttled and fall behind reading data. This caused the matching data to not show up in time during the queries. Some of our attempts would not return all the expected 10 records.\n\n\nUsing our metrics that were captured using our in-house metrics aggregation system (that our IMetricsConsumer publishes to), let's take a look at the CPU, Heap utilizations.\n\n\nBefore you look at the figures:\n\n\n\n\nAll the figures below are for the same time interval. The X-axis represents time in \n1 minute\n intervals\n\n\nFigure 1\n shows the number of queries running for a time interval\n\n\nThe other figures show a metric across \nall\n the workers (JVMs) in the Storm topology, each running a mix of a components (spouts reading from Kafka, Filter Bolts etc)\n\n\nThe majority of the components (excluding ackers) are spouts reading from Kafka or Filter Bolts, so the figures can be taken to be primarily describing those workers\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Queries running\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. CPU user-time usage\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. On Heap usage\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Garbage Collection times\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n shows that we first ran 100 queries, then 200, then 400 and finally 300. The numbers go over their target because we only added a 2 s buffer in our script. Network and tick delays caused some queries to not be entirely purged before the next set of N simultaneous queries came in.\n\n\nFigure 2\n shows the milliseconds of CPU time used per minute. For example, a value of \n300K ms\n ms for a line (worker) means that the worker used \n300K ms/min\n  or \n300s/60s\n or \n5\n CPU cores (virtual) in that minute.\n\n\nFigure 3\n shows raw numbers for Heap utilizations in bytes.\n\n\nFigure 4\n shows the time spent garbage collecting in ms.\n\n\n\n\nGarbage collection\n\n\nAs we increase the number of queries sent into Bullet, more objects are created in the Filter and Join Bolts. These quickly fill up our heap and cause GCs. The zig-zags represents heaps being cleared after GC and filling back up quickly. Also, note that the CPU usage is directly related to the GC times. In other words, performance is pretty much directly correlated with the amount of GC we do.\n\n\n\n\nThe following table summarizes these figures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimultaneous Queries\n\n\nAverage CPU (ms)\n\n\nAverage Result size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n90K\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n130K\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n170K\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n230K\n\n\n8.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n270K\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nWe are able to run somewhere between 200 and 300 \nRAW\n queries simultaneously before losing data.\n\n\nTest 4: Improving the maximum number of simultaneous \nRAW\n queries\n\n\nThe \nlast test\n showed us that the \nstandard configuration\n lets us run somewhere from 200 and 300 \nRAW\n queries. Let's improve that. The \nGC times\n and the \nheap usage\n tell us that a larger heap may help. Also, since each of our machines has 256 GB of RAM and we have a lot of unused heap being wasted per machine (since we use up all the CPU cores), we can be use a lot more heap and not have to GC so much. Let's also try to make the worker even leaner by decreasing the max worker size so that slow components don't block others.\n\n\nChanges:\n\n\n-bullet.topology.filter.bolt.memory.on.heap.load: 384.0\n+bullet.topology.filter.bolt.memory.on.heap.load: 1024.0\n\n- --bullet-spout-on-heap-memory-load 768.0 \\\n+ --bullet-spout-on-heap-memory-load 1280.0 \\\n\n- -c topology.worker.max.heap.size.mb=4096.0 \\\n+ -c topology.worker.max.heap.size.mb=3072.0 \\\n\n\n\n\nOur resource utilization is now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n\nParallelism\n\n\nCPU (cores)\n\n\nOn Heap Memory (MiB)\n\n\nOff Heap Memory (MiB)\n\n\nTotal Memory (MiB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataSource Spout\n\n\n64\n\n\n64\n\n\n1280.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n94208\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter Bolt\n\n\n128\n\n\n128\n\n\n1024.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n155648\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Bolt\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n384.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n1152\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDRPC Spout\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n128.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n640\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepareRequest Bolt\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n128.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n320\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturnResults Bolt\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n128.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n320\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMetricsConsumer\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n128.0\n\n\n0\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAckers\n\n\n256\n\n\n25.6\n\n\n128.0\n\n\n0\n\n\n32768\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n455\n\n\n219.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n285184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur data volume across this test was: \nData: 84,000 R/s and 124 MiB/s\n\n\nResult\n\n\nWith this configuration, we were able to run 700 queries simultaneously and failed at some where between 700 and 800. See below for why.\n\n\nWe notice that the GC times have improved a lot (down to ~12K ms from ~35K ms in \nFigure 4\n). While our overall CPU usage seems to have gone down since we GC a lot less, remember that our changes to the maximum worker size makes our workers run less components and as a result, use less CPU. This is why there are more lines overall (more workers).\n\n\nFigure 5. Queries running\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. CPU user-time usage\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. On Heap usage\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.

This is actually due how the blocking implementation of Storm DRPC works. Storm DRPC currently dedicates a thread to each DRPC request and does not allow more requests till they are finished. For Bullet, when we ran 800 queries for the test, only the first 735 would even be sent to Bullet. The rest 65 would be sent after some of the first return but all of those 65 would return 0 records because the data that they are looking for had long since been processed. We had \n3\n DRPC servers in the cluster and you could \nscale by adding more of these\n.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nWith this change in heap usage, we could get to \n735\n of these queries simultaneously without any issues. We could do more but were limited by the number of DRPC servers in our cluster.\n\n\n\n\n735 is a hard limit then?\n\n\nThis is what our Storm cluster's configuration and our usage of the Storm DRPC limits us to. There is an async implementation for DRPC that we could eventually switch to. If we used another PubSub implementation like Kafka, we would be able to bypass this limit.\n\n\n\n\nTesting on Kafka 0.10.0.1\n\n\nFor this and subsequent tests, we upgraded our Kafka cluster to 0.10. We used the new Kafka consumer APIs to read \nbatches\n of messages instead of a message at a time. We changed our DataSource Spout to read batches of messages (raw bytes) instead and added a DataSource Bolt that converts each batch message into Bullet records. Switching to this model let us be a lot more efficient in our data reading.\n\n\nTo read more data, we will be trying to read a topic that is a superset of our data set so far and produces up to \n13\n times the number of records (maximum of 1.3 million records/sec) and \n20\n times the size of the data we were reading till now. This Kafka topic has \n256\n partitions.\n\n\nTest 5: Reading more Data\n\n\nOur average data volume across this test was: \nData: 756,000 R/s and 3080 MiB/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n\nParallelism\n\n\nCPU (cores)\n\n\nOn Heap Memory (MiB)\n\n\nOff Heap Memory (MiB)\n\n\nTotal Memory (MiB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataSource Spout\n\n\n128\n\n\n128\n\n\n1024.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n155648\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataSource Bolt\n\n\n256\n\n\n512\n\n\n2580.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n709632\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter Bolt\n\n\n512\n\n\n512\n\n\n1024.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n622592\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Bolt\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n512.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n1408\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDRPC Spout\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n128.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n640\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepareRequest Bolt\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n128.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n320\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturnResults Bolt\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n128.0\n\n\n192.0\n\n\n320\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMetricsConsumer\n\n\n4\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n128.0\n\n\n0\n\n\n512\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAckers\n\n\n256\n\n\n25.6\n\n\n128.0\n\n\n0\n\n\n32768\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n1162\n\n\n1179.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1523840\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of \nour machines\n, the CPU is clearly the limiting factor. We end up using about \n25\n machines to run this topology.\n\n\nWe also tweaked our GC and Storm settings. We ran the topology with the following command:\n\n\nstorm jar\n          ...\n          --bullet-conf bullet_settings.yaml \\\n          -c topology.max.spout.pending=30 \\\n          -c topology.backpressure.enable=false \\\n          -c topology.acker.executors=256 \\\n          -c topology.component.resources.onheap.memory.mb=128.0 \\\n          -c topology.worker.max.heap.size.mb=3072.0 \\\n          -c topology.worker.gc.childopts=\n-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:NewSize=128m -XX:NewRatio=2 -XX:SurvivorRatio=6 -XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly -XX:-CMSConcurrentMTEnabled -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=50 -XX:ParallelGCThreads=8 -XX:ConcGCThreads=4\n \\\n          ...\n\n\n\n\nWe capped the GC threads to \n8\n and \n4\n, which helps performance on our 48 core machines when multiple JVMs run on a machine. We also bumped up the Young Generation size (\nNewRatio=2\n) and triggered the CMS collection to run at \n50%\n of Old Generation instead of the default of \n70%\n. Our objects are short-lived in our streaming scenario, this makes sense. We arrived at this after a few iterations, which we'll skip here for brevity.\n\n\n\n\nMax Spout Pending is now 30 ?!\n\n\nWe use \ntopology.max.spout.pending\n as a way to throttle how fast we read from Kafka. There is no acking past the Filter Bolt. The maximum number of batch messages we read is \n500\n from Kafka. This makes our true max spout pending: \n500 * 30 = 15,000\n. The tuple that is emitted from the spout is a large tuple that contains up to \n500\n records and we limit up to \n30\n of those to go unacked from any single spout before we throttle it. Since we have \n128\n spouts, we can have \n128 * 15,000\n messages unacked in the topology at any time at the most.\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nWe were able to run over 600 queries with this configuration and failed in the high 600s due to hitting the DRPC limit again. With our improved reading model and GC configs, our base resource footprint has improved from \n50K\n CPU ms/min to around \n25K\n CPU ms/min.\n\n\nFigure 9. Queries running\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.

So we have roughly increased the parallelism of the components reading the data by 10x (\n128 + 512 = 768\n cores to read and convert the data whereas previously we were using \n64\n cores). Once this is fixed and we can read the data comfortably using our DataSource Spouts and Bolts, we can scale the Filter Bolts and other components to accommodate for queries. We set our Filter Bolt parallelism (dominates the rest of the components) to \n512\n. We need about \n25\n machines (5 times more than the previous of \n5\n).\n\n\nWith this configuration, we were able to run \n680\n queries simultaneously before we hit the DRPC limit. Since DRPC is a shared resource for the cluster, this limit is slightly lower than the previously observed number possibly due to our test environment being multi-tenant and other topologies using the shared resource.\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring latency in Bullet\n\n\nSo far, we have been using data being delayed long enough as a proxy for queries failing. \nBullet-Storm 0.4.3\n adds an average latency metric computed in the Filter Bolts. For the next tests, we add a timestamp in the Data Source spouts when the record is read and this latency metric tells us exactly how long it takes for the record to be matched against a query and acked. By setting a limit for this latency, we can much more accurately measure acceptable performance.\n\n\n\n\nTest 6: Scaling for More Data\n\n\nFor this test, we'll establish how much resources we need to read various data volumes.

Data Volume vs CPU\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14. Data Volume vs Memory\n\n\n\n\nAs these figures show, Bullet scales pretty linearly for more data.  For each core of CPU core, we need about 1.2 GiB of Memory. That is the, CPU to Memory ratio is \n1 core : 1.2 GiB\n. The slopes of figures show that the CPU to data ratio is \n1 core : 850 R/s\n or \n1 core : 3.4 MiB/s\n.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThis test demonstrates that Bullet scales pretty linearly for reading more data. We were able to support at least \n400\nqueries with plenty of headroom for each configuration. Each CPU core required about 1.2 GiB of Memory and gave us roughly 800 R/s or 3.4 MiB/s processing capability. Of course, this is particular to our data. As mentioned in the \ndata section\n, most of our data was concentrated in random maps. This means that in memory, the data is generally not contiguous. This creates memory fragmentation and more GC pressure. Depending on your data schema, your performance may be a lot better.\n\n\nTest 7: Scaling for More Queries\n\n\nFor this test, we'll establish how much resources we need to support more queries for a fixed data volume: \nData: 68,400 R/s and 105 MiB/s\n.\n\n\nAs our 3 server DRPC cluster currently does not let us do more than \n680 RAW\n queries, in this test, we will:\n\n\n\n\nVary the number of Filter Bolts as they are the primary bottleneck for supporting more queries.\n\n\nTo simplify things, we will only vary the \nparallelism\n and fix the CPU and memory of each Filter Bolt to \n1 Core\n and \n1 GiB Memory\n\n\nWe will use \nRAW\n queries as the queries to scale\n\n\nEach \nRAW\n query will run for \n30 s\n and search for \n10\n records that we generate. The query will actually look for \n11\n records to force it to run for the full \n30 s\n. This is because we want to stress the Filter Bolt as much as possible. As long as there is a query in the system, the Filter Bolt will deserialize and check every record that it processes\n\n\nWe will measure the same filtering latency: the time taken from the record read in DataSource Spout to its emission in the Filter Bolt. We want the maximum latency to be less than \n200 ms\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter Bolt Parallelism\n\n\nQueries\n\n\nAverage Latency (ms)\n\n\nStatus\n\n\nTopology CPU (cores)\n\n\nTopology Memory (MiB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n78.3\n\n\n112256\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n7\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n8\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n8\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n10\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n12\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n167\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n1002\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n82.3\n\n\n117120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n9\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n9\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n80\n\n\n9\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n10\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120\n\n\n14\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n140\n\n\n18\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n160\n\n\n298\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170\n\n\n2439\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n86.3\n\n\n121984\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n160\n\n\n13\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n14\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n240\n\n\n78\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n280\n\n\n274\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n320\n\n\n680\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n360\n\n\n1700\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n2685\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90.3\n\n\n126848\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n30\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n350\n\n\n44\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n481\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n450\n\n\n935\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n1968\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n550\n\n\n3267\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n94.3\n\n\n131712\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n350\n\n\n15\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n18\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n450\n\n\n28\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n40\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n550\n\n\n670\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n1183\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n650\n\n\n1924\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n98.3\n\n\n136576\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n450\n\n\n17\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n22\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n550\n\n\n30\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n377\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n650\n\n\n490\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n102.3\n\n\n141440\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n550\n\n\n39\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n53\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n650\n\n\n468\n\n\nFAIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n106.3\n\n\n146304\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n26\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n650\n\n\n32\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following figure summarizes the minimum number of CPU cores (which are also the number of Filter Bolts) needed to support the the maximum number of \nRAW\n queries with latency \n 200 ms.\n\n\nFigure 15.

This particular version of Bullet on Storm was  prior to the architecture shift  to a PubSub layer but this would be the equivalent to using the Storm DRPC PubSub layer on a newer version of Bullet on Storm. You can replace DRPC spout and PrepareRequest bolt with Query spout and ReturnResults bolt with Result bolt conceptually. The actual implementation of the DRPC based PubSub layer just uses these spout and bolt implementations underneath anyway for the Publishers and Subscribers so the parallelisms and CPU utilizations should map 1-1.  Using the pluggable metrics interface in Bullet on Storm, we captured worker level metrics such as CPU time, Heap usage, GC times and types, sent them to a in-house monitoring service for time-slicing and graphing.

The spout parallelism is 64 because it is going to read from a Kafka topic with 64 partitions (any more is meaningless since it cannot be split further). It reads and converts the data into Bullet Records.  We've fanned out from the spouts to the Filter Bolts by a ratio of 2. We may or may not need this.  We use  topology.max.spout.pending=20000  to limit the number of in-flight tuples there can be from a DataSource Spout instance and throttle it if too many queries are slowing down processing downstream. This is set pretty high to account for catch-up and skew in our Kafka partitions  We have set the max heap size for a worker to  4 GiB  since we do not want too large of a worker. If a component dies or a worker is killed by RAS, it will not affect too many other components. It also makes heap dumps etc manageable.  We set  topology.worker.gc.childopts  to use  ParNewGC  and  CMS . These are our cluster defaults but we are listing them here since this may not be true for all Storm clusters. We have also added the  -XX:NewRatio=1  to the defaults since most of our objects are short-lived and having a larger Young Generation reduces our Young Generation GC (ParNew) frequency.  We are using 256 acker tasks. There is acking from the DataSource Spout to the Filter Bolt and from the DRPCSpout and the PrepareRequestBolt, so about ~130 components will be acking.

To simplify things, we will only vary the  parallelism  and fix the CPU and memory of each Filter Bolt to  1 Core  and  1 GiB Memory  We will use  RAW  queries as the queries to scale  Each  RAW  query will run for  30 s  and search for  10  records that we generate. The query will actually look for  11  records to force it to run for the full  30 s . This is because we want to stress the Filter Bolt as much as possible. As long as there is a query in the system, the Filter Bolt will deserialize and check every record that it processes  We will measure the same filtering latency: the time taken from the record read in DataSource Spout to its emission in the Filter Bolt.

Here is an example if you use Scala and Maven:  repositories \n     repository \n         snapshots \n             enabled false /enabled \n         /snapshots \n         id central /id \n         name bintray /name \n         url http://jcenter.bintray.com /url \n     /repository  /repositories   properties \n     scala.version 2.11.7 /scala.version \n     scala.dep.version 2.11 /scala.dep.version \n     spark.version 2.3.0 /spark.version \n     bullet.spark.version 0.1.1 /bullet.spark.version  /properties  dependency \n     groupId org.scala-lang /groupId \n     artifactId scala-library /artifactId \n     version ${scala.version} /version \n     scope provided /scope  /dependency  dependency \n     groupId org.apache.spark /groupId \n     artifactId spark-streaming_${scala.dep.version} /artifactId \n     version ${spark.version} /version \n     scope provided /scope  /dependency  dependency \n     groupId org.apache.spark /groupId \n     artifactId spark-core_${scala.dep.version} /artifactId \n     version ${spark.version} /version \n     scope provided /scope  /dependency  dependency \n      groupId com.yahoo.bullet /groupId \n      artifactId bullet-spark /artifactId \n      version ${bullet.spark.version} /version  /dependency   You can also add  classifier sources /classifier  or  classifier javadoc /classifier  if you want the sources or javadoc.",

We used a \nRAW query without any filtering\n to measure the latency added by Bullet Spark. This is not the end-to-end latency for a query.

On average, 1 CPU core and 3GB memory were used in this experiment. CPU and memory usages go slowly up while queries number goes up but they are still within resource limits. We can easily run up to 1500 RAW queries simultaneously in this test.\n\n\nTest 3: Scalability for larger data\n\n\nThis test was done on the larger data.

On average, 1.2 CPU core and average 5GB memory were used in this experiment. But with queries number goes up, some of the executors memory usage were up to 8-10GB which is close to our resource limits. With more queries running, OOM may happen. So in this experiment, we can only afford up to 800 queries simultaneously.",

            "text": "PubSub Architecture\n\n\nThis section describes how the Publish-Subscribe or \nPubSub layer\n works in Bullet.\n\n\nWhy a PubSub?\n\n\nWhen we initially created Bullet, it was built on \nApache Storm\n and leveraged a feature in it called Storm DRPC to deliver queries to and extract results from the Bullet Backend. Storm DRPC is supported by a set of clusters that are physically part of the Storm cluster and is a shared resource for the cluster. While many other stream processors support some form of RPC and we could support multiple versions of the Web Service for those, it quickly became clear that abstracting the transport layer from the Web Service to the Backend was needed. This was particularly highlighted when we wanted to switch Bullet queries from operating in a request-response model (one response at the end of the query) to a streaming model. Streaming responses back to the user for a query through DRPC would be cumbersome and require a lot of logic to handle. A PubSub system was a natural solution to this. Since DRPC was a shared resource per cluster, we also were \ntying the Backend's scalability\n to a resource that we didn't control.\n\n\nHowever, we didn't want to pick a particular PubSub like Kafka and restrict a user's choice. So, we added a PubSub layer that was generic and entirely pluggable into both the Backend and the Web Service. We would support a select few like \nKafka\n or \nStorm DRPC\n.

This is the \nQUERY_SUBMISSION\n context and this is PubSub mode for the Web Service\n\n\nReading queries and submitting results. This is the \nQUERY_PROCESSING\n context and this is PubSub mode for the Backend\n\n\n\n\nA PubSub provides Publisher and Subscriber instances that, depending on which context it is in, do the right thing. Publishers in \nQUERY_SUBMISSION\n write queries to your PubSub whereas in \nQUERY_PROCESSING\n, they write results. Similarly, the Subscribers in \nQUERY_SUBMISSION\n read results but read queries in \nQUERY_PROCESSING\n. A Publisher and Subscriber in a particular context make up read and write halves of the \npipes\n for stream of queries and stream of results.\n\n\nMessages\n\n\nThe PubSub layer does not deal with queries and results and just works on instances of messages of type \ncom.yahoo.bullet.pubsub.PubSubMessage\n. These \nPubSubMessages\n are keyed (\nid\n and \nsequence\n), store content and metadata. This is a light wrapper around the payload and is tailored to work with multiple results per query and support communicating additional information and signals to and from the PubSub in addition to just queries and results.\n\n\nChoosing a PubSub implementation\n\n\nIf you want to use an implementation already built, we currently support:\n\n\n\n\nKafka\n for any Backend\n\n\nREST\n for any Backend\n\n\nStorm DRPC\n if you're using Bullet on Storm as your Backend\n\n\n\n\nImplementing your own PubSub\n\n\nThe core of the PubSub interfaces are defined in the \ncore Bullet library\n that you can \ndepend on\n.\n\n\nTo create a PubSub, you should extend the abstract class \ncom.yahoo.bullet.pubsub.PubSub\n and implement the abstract methods for getting instances of Publishers (\ncom.yahoo.bullet.pubsub.Publisher\n) and Subscribers (\ncom.yahoo.bullet.pubsub.Subscriber\n). Depending on how you have configured the Web Service and the Backend, they will call the required methods to get the required number of Publishers or Subscribers to parallelize the reading or the writing. You should ensure that they are thread-safe. They will most likely be tied to your units of parallelisms for the underlying PubSub you are invoking.\n\n\nIf you are running sharded instances of your Web Service, you should ensure that your Publishers writing queries add Metadata to the messages to help the Publishers writing results to send the results back to the right Web Service instance that is waiting for them.\n\n\nReliability\n\n\nYou can choose to make your Publishers and Subscribers as reliable as you want. Both the Web Service and the Backend will call the appropriate reliability methods (\ncommit\n and \nfail\n) but your implementations can choose to be no-ops if you do not want to be reliability. Alternatively, if you want make your Subscribers reliable, you could use an in-memory reliable implementation of one by extending \ncom.yahoo.bullet.pubsub.BufferingSubscriber\n for a simple implementation. This keeps track of uncommitted messages in memory up to a configured threshold (does not read more messages if there are this many uncommitted messages left) and re-emits messages on failures using it.\n\n\nCanonical example\n\n\nFor an example of a PubSub implementation, see the \nBullet Kafka PubSub project\n. This is implemented in Java and is a simple implementation that wraps the Kafka client APIs. It supports reliability through the use of the \nBufferingSubscriber\n mentioned above. It allows you to specify one or two Kafka topics for queries and results. It can be sharded across multiple Web Service machines using Kafka topic partitions.

Storm DRPC is supported by a set of clusters that are physically part of the Storm cluster and is a shared resource for the cluster. While many other stream processors support some form of RPC and we could support multiple versions of the Web Service for those, it quickly became clear that abstracting the transport layer from the Web Service to the Backend was needed. This was particularly highlighted when we wanted to switch Bullet queries from operating in a request-response model (one response at the end of the query) to a streaming model. Streaming responses back to the user for a query through DRPC would be cumbersome and require a lot of logic to handle. A PubSub system was a natural solution to this. Since DRPC was a shared resource per cluster, we also were  tying the Backend's scalability  to a resource that we didn't control.  However, we didn't want to pick a particular PubSub like Kafka and restrict a user's choice. So, we added a PubSub layer that was generic and entirely pluggable into both the Backend and the Web Service. We would support a select few like  Kafka  or  Storm DRPC .

It uses \nApache Kafka\n as the backing PubSub queue and works on all Backends.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\nThe implementation by default asks you to create two topics in a Kafka cluster - one for queries and another for results. The Web Service publishes queries to the queries topic and reads results from the results topic. Similarly, the Backend reads queries from the queries topic and writes results to the results topic. All messages are sent as \nPubSubMessages\n.\n\n\nYou do not need to have two topics. You can have one but you should use multiple partitions and configure your Web Service and Backend to produce to and consume from the right partitions. See the \nsetup\n section for more details.\n\n\n\n\nKafka Client API\n\n\nThe Bullet Kafka implementation uses the Kafka 0.10.2 client APIs. Generally, your forward or backward compatibilities should work as expected.\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nBefore setting up, you will need a Kafka cluster setup with your topic(s) created. This cluster need only be a couple of machines if it's devoted for Bullet. However, this depends on your query and result volumes. Generally, these are at most a few hundred or thousands of messages per second and a small Kafka cluster will suffice.\n\n\nTo setup Kafka, follow the \ninstructions here\n.\n\n\nPlug into the Backend\n\n\nDepending on how your Backend is built, either add Bullet Kafka to your classpath or include it in your build tool. Head over to our \nreleases page\n for getting the artifacts. If you're adding Bullet Kafka to the classpath instead of building a fat jar, you will need to get the jar with the classifier: \nfat\n since you will need Bullet Kafka and all its dependencies.\n\n\nConfigure the backend to use the Kafka PubSub:\n\n\nbullet.pubsub.context.name: \nQUERY_PROCESSING\n\nbullet.pubsub.class.name: \ncom.yahoo.bullet.kafka.KafkaPubSub\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.bootstrap.servers: \nserver1:port1,server2:port2,...\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.request.topic.name: \nyour-query-topic\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.response.topic.name: \nyour-result-topic\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will then need to configure the Publishers and Subscribers. For details on what to configure and what the defaults are, see the \nconfiguration file\n.\n\n\nPlug into the Web Service\n\n\nYou will need the Head over to our \nreleases page\n and get the JAR artifact with the \nfat\n classifier. For example, you can download the artifact for the 0.2.0 release \ndirectly from JCenter\n).\n\n\nYou should then plug in this JAR to your Web Service following the instructions \nhere\n.\n\n\nFor configuration, you should \nfollow the steps here\n to create and provide a YAML file to the Web Service. Remember to change the context to \nQUERY_SUBMISSION\n.\n\n\nbullet.pubsub.context.name: \nQUERY_SUBMISSION\n\nbullet.pubsub.class.name: \ncom.yahoo.bullet.kafka.KafkaPubSub\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.bootstrap.servers: \nserver1:port1,server2:port2,...\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.request.topic.name: \nyour-query-topic\n\nbullet.pubsub.kafka.response.topic.name: \nyour-result-topic\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with the Backend, you will then need to configure the Publishers and Subscribers. See the \nconfiguration file\n. Remember that your Subscribers in the Backend are reading what the Producers in your Web Service are producing and vice-versa, so make sure to match up the topics and settings accordingly if you have any custom changes.\n\n\nPassthrough Configuration\n\n\nYou can pass additional Kafka Producer or Consumer properties to the PubSub Publishers and Subscribers by prefixing them with either \nbullet.pubsub.kafka.producer.\n for Producers or \nbullet.pubsub.kafka.consumer.\n for Consumers. The PubSub configuration uses and provides a few defaults for settings it thinks is important to manage. You can tweak them and add others. For a list of properties that you can configure, see the \nProducer\n or \nConsumer\n configs in Kafka.\n\n\n\n\nTypes for the properties\n\n\nAll Kafka properties are better off specified as Strings since Kafka type casts them accordingly. If you provide types, you might run into issues where YAML types do not match what the Kafka client is expecting.\n\n\n\n\nPartitions\n\n\nYou may choose to partition your topics for a couple of reasons:\n\n\n\n\nYou may have one topic for both queries and responses and use partitions as a way to separate them.\n\n\nYou may use two topics and partition one or both for scalability when reading and writing\n\n\nYou may use two topics and partition one or both for sharding across multiple Web Service instances (and multiple instances in your Backend)\n\n\n\n\nYou can accomplish all this with partition maps. You can configure what partitions your Publishers (Web Service or Backend) will write to using \nbullet.pubsub.kafka.request.partitions\n and what partitions your Subscribers will read from using \nbullet.pubsub.kafka.response.partitions\n. Providing these to an instance of the Web Service or the Backend in the YAML file ensures that the Publishers in that instance only write to these request partitions and Subscribers only read from the response partitions. The Publishers will randomly adds one of the response partitions in the messages sent to ensure that the responses only arrive to one of those partitions this instance's Subscribers are waiting on. For more details, see the \nconfiguration file\n.\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nIf you're using secure Kafka, you will need to do the necessary metadata setup to make sure your principals have access to your topic(s) for reading and writing. If you're using SSL for securing your Kafka cluster, you will need to add the necessary SSL certificates to the keystore for your JVM before launching the Web Service or the Backend.\n\n\nStorm\n\n\nWe have tested Kafka with \nBullet Storm\n using \nKerberos\n from the Storm cluster and SSL from the Web Service. For Kerberos, you may need to add a \nJAAS\n \nconfig file\n to the \nStorm BlobStore\n and add it to your worker JVMs. To do this, you will need a JAAS configuration entry. For example, if your Kerberos KDC is shared with your Storm cluster's KDC, you may be adding a jaas_file.conf with\n\n\nKafkaClient {\n   org.apache.storm.security.auth.kerberos.AutoTGTKrb5LoginModule required\n   serviceName=\nkafka\n;\n};\n\n\n\n\nPut this file into Storm's BlobStore using:\n\n\nstorm blobstore create --file jaas_file.conf --acl o::rwa,u:$USER:rwa --repl-fctr 3 jaas_file.conf\n\n\n\n\nThen while launching your topology, you should provide as arguments to the \nstorm jar\n command, the following arguments:\n\n\n-c topology.blobstore.map='{\njaas_file.conf\n: {} }' \\\n-c topology.worker.childopts=\n-Djava.security.auth.login.config=./jaas_file.conf\n \\\n\n\n\n\nThis will add this to all your worker JVMs. You can refresh Kerberos credentials periodically and push credentials to Storm as \nmentioned here\n.",

            "text": "The Web Service\n\n\nThe Web Service is a Java JAR file that you can deploy on a machine to communicate with the Bullet Backend. You then plug in a particular Bullet PubSub implementation such as \nKafka PubSub\n or \nStorm DRPC PubSub\n. For an example on how to set up a Bullet backend, see the \nStorm example setup\n.\n\n\nThere are two main purposes for this layer at this time:\n\n\n1) It provides an endpoint that can serve a \nJSON API schema\n for the Bullet UI. Currently, static schemas from a file are supported.\n\n\n2) It generates unique identifiers and other metadata for a JSON Bullet query before sending the query to the Bullet backend. It wraps errors if the backend is unreachable.\n\n\n\n\nThat's it?\n\n\nThe Web Service essentially just wraps the PubSub layer and provides some helpful endpoints. When incremental updates drop, it will translate a PubSub's streaming responses back into incremental results for the user. It is also there to be a point of abstraction for implementing things like security, monitoring, access-control, rate-limiting, sharding, different query formats (e.g. SQL Bullet queries) etc, which are planned in the near future.\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nIn order for your Web Service to work with Bullet, you should have an instance of the Backend such as \nStorm\n and a PubSub instance such as \nStorm DRPC\n or \nKafka\n already set up. Alternitively you can run the RESTPubSub as part of the web service. See \nRESTPubSub\n for more info.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nYou can download the JAR file directly from \nJCenter\n. The Web Service is a \nSpring Boot\n application. It executes as a standalone application. Note that prior to version 0.1.1, bullet-service was a WAR file that you deployed onto a servlet container like Jetty. It now embeds a \nApache Tomcat\n servlet container.\n\n\nIf you need to depend on the source code directly (to add new endpoints for your own purposes or to build a WAR file out of the JAR), you need to add the JCenter repository and get the artifact through your dependency management system. Maven is shown below.\n\n\nrepositories\n\n    \nrepository\n\n        \nsnapshots\n\n            \nenabled\nfalse\n/enabled\n\n        \n/snapshots\n\n        \nid\ncentral\n/id\n\n        \nname\nbintray\n/name\n\n        \nurl\nhttp://jcenter.bintray.com\n/url\n\n    \n/repository\n\n\n/repositories\n\n\n\n\n\ndependency\n\n  \ngroupId\ncom.yahoo.bullet\n/groupId\n\n  \nartifactId\nbullet-service\n/artifactId\n\n  \nversion\n${bullet.version}\n/version\n\n\n/dependency\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also add \nclassifier\nsources\n/classifier\n  or \nclassifier\njavadoc\n/classifier\n if you want the source or javadoc or \nclassifier\nembedded\n/classifier\n if you want the full JAR with the embedded web server.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThere are two levels of configuration:\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure the Web Service, the web server and other Spring Boot settings through a configuration file (or through the command line when launching). By default, this file is called \napplication.yaml\n. This is where settings like where to find your schema file (optional for if you want to power the \nUI\n schema with a static file) or how many publishers and subscribers to use for your PubSub etc.\n\n\nYou can configure what PubSub to use, the various settings for it through another configuration file. The location for this file is provided in the Web Service configuration step above.\n\n\n\n\nWeb Service Configuration\n\n\nTake a look at the \nsettings\n for a list of the settings that are configured. The Web Service settings start with \nbullet.\n.\n\n\nIf you provide a custom settings \napplication.yaml\n, you will \nneed\n to specify the default values in this file since the framework uses your file instead of these defaults.\n\n\nFile based schema\n\n\nThe Web Service can also provide a endpoint that serves your data schema to your UI. You do not necessarily have to use this to serve your schema. The UI can use any JSON API schema specification. But if your schema is fixed or does not change often, it might be simpler for you to use this endpoint to provide the schema for the UI, instead of creating a new one. The Web Service also takes care to provide the right \nCORS\n headers so that your UI can communicate with it.\n\n\nYou can use \nsample_columns.json\n as a guideline for what your actual schema file should look like or if you want to create your own Web Service that dynamically serves your schema to the UI if it changes frequently.\n\n\nOnce you have your schema file, you can provide it to the Web Service by setting the \nbullet.schema.file\n to the path to your file.\n\n\nSpring Boot Configuration\n\n\nYou can also configure various Spring and web server here. Take a look at \nthis page\n page for the various values you can supply.\n\n\nPubSub Configuration\n\n\nYou configure the PubSub by providing a configuration YAML file and setting the \nbullet.pubsub.config\n to its path. In \nthat\n file, you will set these two settings at a minimum:\n\n\n\n\nbullet.pubsub.class.name\n should be set to the fully qualified package to your PubSub implementation. Example: \ncom.yahoo.bullet.kafka.KafkaPubSub\n for the \nKafka PubSub\n.\n\n\nbullet.pubsub.context.name: QUERY_SUBMISSION\n. The Web Service requires the PubSub to be in the \nQUERY_SUBMISSION\n context.\n\n\n\n\nYou will also specify other parameters that your chosen PubSub requires or can use.\n\n\nLaunch\n\n\nTo launch, you will need your PubSub implementation JAR file and launch the application by providing the path to it. For example, if you only wished to provide the PubSub configuration and you had the Web Service jar and your chosen PubSub (say Kafka) in your current directory, you would run:\n\n\njava -Dloader.path=bullet-kafka.jar -jar bullet-service.jar --bullet.pubsub.config=pubsub_settings.yaml  --logging.level.root=INFO\n\n\n\n\nThis launches the Web Service using Kafka as the PubSub, no custom schema (the default sample columns) and the default values in \nsettings\n. It also uses a root logging level of \nINFO\n.\n\n\nYou could also tweak the various Bullet Web Service or Spring Boot settings by passing them in to the command above. For instance, you could also provide a path to your schema file using \n--bullet.schema.file=/path/to/schema.json\n. You could also have a custom \napplication.yaml\n file (you can change the name using \nspring.config.name\n) and pass it to the Web Service instead by running:\n\n\njava -Dloader.path=bullet-kafka.jar -jar bullet-service.jar --spring.config.location=application.yaml\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nOnce the Web Service is up, you should be able to test to see if it's able to talk to the Bullet Backend:\n\n\nYou can HTTP POST a Bullet query to the API with:\n\n\ncurl -s -H \nContent-Type: text/plain\n -X POST -d '{}' http://localhost:5555/api/bullet/query\n\n\n\n\nYou should receive a random record flowing through Bullet instantly (if you left the Raw aggregation micro-batch size at the default of 1 when launching the Bullet Backend).\n\n\n\n\nContext Path\n\n\nThe context path, or \"/api/bullet\" in the URL above can be changed using the Spring Boot setting \nserver.context-path\n. You can also change the port (defaults to port 5555) using \nserver.port\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you provided a path to a schema file in your configuration file when you \nlaunch\n the Web Service, you can also HTTP GET your schema at \nhttp://localhost:5555/api/bullet/columns\n\n\nIf you did not, the schema in \nsample_columns.json\n is the response. The Web Service converts it to a JSON API response and provides the right headers for CORS.",

If the list contains maps instead of primitives, the values in the maps are used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: These operators are all typed based on the type of the \nleft hand side\n from the Bullet record. If the elements on the right hand side cannot be\ncasted to the types on the LHS, those items will be ignored for the comparison.\n\n\nThe format for a Relational filter is:\n\n\n{\n    \noperation\n: \n== | != | \n= | \n= | \n | \n | RLIKE | SIZEIS | CONTAINSKEY | CONTAINSVALUE\n\n    \nfield\n: \nrecord_field_name | map_field.subfield\n,\n    \nvalues\n: [\n        { \nkind\n: \nVALUE\n, \nvalue\n: \nfoo\n},\n        { \nkind\n: \nFIELD\n, \nvalue\n: \nanother_record_field_name\n}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nNote that you may specify \nVALUE\n or \nKIND\n currently for the \nkind\n key in the entries in the \nvalues\n field above, denoting the type of value this is.

If projections are not specified, the entire record is returned. If you are querying\nfor raw records, you can use projections to help reduce the load on the system and network.\n\n\n{\n    \nfields\n: {\n        \nfieldA\n: \nnewNameA\n,\n        \nfieldB\n: \nnewNameB\n\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAggregations\n\n\nAggregations allow you to perform some operation on the collected records.

This means that if you generate \nN\n points, you will receive \nN+1\n intervals. The points you define should be in the range of the values for your field to get a meaningful distribution.

You will also get a probability of how likely a value will land in the interval per interval in addition to a frequency (or cumulative frequency) count.\n\n\nAs with \nGROUP\n, Bullet will attempt to \ncast\n your field into a numeric type and ignore it if it cannot.\n\n\nTOP K\n\n\nThe following attributes are supported for \nTOP K\n:\n\n\n  \nattributes\n: {\n      \nthreshold\n: \nrestrict results to having at least this count value\n,\n      \nnewName\n: \nresultCountColumnName\n\n  }\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \nK\n in \nTOP K\n is specified using the \nsize\n field in the \naggregation\n object.\n\n\nWindow\n\n\nThe \"window\" field is \noptional\n and allows you to instruct Bullet to return incremental results. For example you might want to return the COUNT of a field and return that count every 2 seconds.\n\n\nIf \"window\" is omitted Bullet will emit only a single result at the very end of the query.\n\n\nAn example window might look like this:\n\n\nwindow\n: { \nemit\n: { \ntype\n: \nTIME/RECORD\n, \nevery\n: 5000 },\n            \ninclude\n: { \ntype\n: \nTIME/RECORD/ALL\n, \nfirst\n: 5000 } },\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nSubField\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemit\n\n\n\n\nThis object specifies when a window should be emitted and the current results sent back to the user\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\nMust be \"TIME\" or \"RECORD\" - specifying if the window should be emitted after X number of milliseconds, or X number of records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevery\n\n\nThe number of milliseconds or records (determined by \"type\" above) that will be contained in the emitted window\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninclude\n\n\n\n\nThis object specifies what will be included in the emitted window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\nMust be \"TIME\", \"RECORD\" or \"ALL\" - specifying if the window should include X number of milliseconds, X number of records, or all results since the beginning of the whole query\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfirst\n\n\nSpecifies the number of records/milliseconds at the beginning of this window to include in the emitted result - it should be omitted if \"type\" is \"ALL\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Not all windowing types are supported at this time.\n\n\nCurrently Bullet supports the following window types\n:\n\n\n\n\nTime-Based Tumbling Windows\n\n\nAdditive Tumbling Windows\n\n\nReactive Record-Based Windows\n\n\nNo Window\n\n\n\n\nSupport for more windows will be added in the future.\n\n\nEach currently supported window type will be described below:\n\n\nTime-Based Tumbling Windows\n\n\nCurrently time-based tumbling windows \nmust\n have emit == include. In other words, only the entire window can be emitted, and windows must be adjacent.\n\n\n\n\nThe above example windowing would be specified with the window:\n\n\nwindow\n: { \nemit\n: { \ntype\n: \nTIME\n, \nevery\n: 3000 },\n            \ninclude\n: { \ntype\n: \nTIME\n, \nfirst\n: 3000 } },\n\n\n\n\nAny aggregation can be done in each window, or the raw records themselves can be returned as specified in the \"aggregation\" object.\n\n\nIn this example the first window would include 3 records, the second would include 4 records, the third would include 3 records and the fourth would include 2 records.\n\n\nAdditive Tumbling Windows\n\n\nAdditive tumbling windows emit with the same logic as time-based tumbling windows, but include ALL results from the beginning of the query:\n\n\n\n\nThe above example would be specified with the window:\n\n\nwindow\n: { \nemit\n: { \ntype\n: \nTIME\n, \nevery\n: 3000 },\n            \ninclude\n: { \ntype\n: \nALL\n } },\n\n\n\n\nIn this example the first window would include 3 records, the second would include 7 records, the third would include 10 records and the fourth would include 12 records.\n\n\nSliding Windows\n\n\nSliding windows emit based on the arrival of an event, rather than after a certain period of time. In general sliding windows often do some aggregation on the previous X records, or on all records that arrived in the last X seconds. At this time, Bullet only supports sliding windows on the previous X records. It does not support sliding windows with any aggregation but \nRAW\n at this time. If you set X to 1, the query will effectively return each record as they arrive to the user.\n\n\n\n\nThe above example would be specified with the window (you may replace every and last with higher values):\n\n\nwindow\n: { \nemit\n: { \ntype\n: \nRECORD\n, \nevery\n: 1 },\n            \ninclude\n: { \ntype\n: \nRECORD\n, \nlast\n: 1 } },\n\n\n\n\nNo Window\n\n\nIf the \"window\" field is optional. If it is  omitted, the query will only emit when the entire query is finished.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nBullet results are JSON objects with two fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrecords\n\n\nThis field contains the list of matching records\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeta\n\n\nThis field is a map that contains meta information about the query, such as the time the query was received, error data, etc. These are configurable at launch time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a detailed description of how to perform these queries and see example results, see \nExamples\n.",

The domain for your points is therefore, all real numbers but you should narrow down to valid values for the field to get meaningful results.  You have three options to generate points.     Method  Keys      Number of Points  You can use the  numberOfPoints  key to provide a number of points to generate evenly distributed in the full range of your domain    Generate Points in a range  You can use  start ,  end  and  increment  ( start     end ,  increment    0) to specify numbers to generate points in a narrower region of your domain    Specify free-form points  You can specify a free-form  array  of numbers which will be used as the points     Note that If you specify more than one way to generate points, the API will use  numberOfPoints , followed by  points , followed by  start ,  end  and  increment  and whichever creates valid points will be used first.  For  PMF  and  CDF , no matter how you specify your points, the first interval will always be  (- , first point)  and the last interval will be  [last point, + ) . You will also get a probability of how likely a value will land in the interval per interval in addition to a frequency (or cumulative frequency) count.  As with  GROUP , Bullet will attempt to  cast  your field into a numeric type and ignore it if it cannot.",

Note the the \nminimum_value\n and the \nmaximum_value\n correspond to the 0th and 100th percentiles. There is also a \nnormalized_rank_error\n that describes the error (see \nbelow\n for a detailed explanation) This is constant for all \nDISTRIBUTION\n queries and does not depend on the data or the query.\n\n\nNormalized Rank Error\n\n\nUnlike \nGROUP\n and \nCOUNT DISTINCT\n, the order in which the data arrives to Bullet can affect the results of a \nDISTRIBUTION\n query. The error when the result is estimated is not a Gaussian error function\nand is not described in terms of the values of your field. In other words, if the 50th percentile was estimated to some value, you could not bound the true median by using the the estimated\nvalue +/- constant (see below for a good approximation). The error is expressed in terms of the \nnormalized rank\n. If one were to sort the true data stream, you would obtain a rank for each item from\n0 to the stream length (\nitems_seen\n in the metadata above). If you then divided each rank by length, you would get ranks from 0 to 1. In this domain, a \nnormalized rank error\n of 0.002, for example, means that a value\nreturned for the 0.50 or 50th percentile could actually lie between 0.498 and 0.502 in the normalized ranks with 99% confidence.\n\n\nDistribution Accuracy\n lists the normalized rank error as a percentage for the maximum size of the Sketch used. If you obtain successive quantile values at\ngranularities lower than this rank error, the results may not be accurate. While the sketch speaks of the normalized rank error, you can still obtain reasonable bounds for values. For example, if the normalized rank\nerror was 1% and you obtained quantile values at 0.48, 0.50 and 0.52, you could use the values at 0.52 and 0.48 as very reasonable upper and lower bounds on your true median (you might even be able to use 0.49 and 0.51\nif the error was 1%).\n\n\nPMF DISTRIBUTION Aggregation\n\n\nBQL Query\n\n\nSELECT FREQ(duration, REGION, 2000, 20000, 500)\nFROM STREAM(5000, TIME)\nLIMIT 100;\n\n\n\n\nJSON Query\n\n\n{\n   \naggregation\n:{\n      \ntype\n:\nDISTRIBUTION\n,\n      \nsize\n:100,\n      \nfields\n:{\n         \nduration\n:\n\n      },\n      \nattributes\n:{\n         \ntype\n:\nPMF\n,\n         \nstart\n:2000,\n         \nend\n:20000,\n         \nincrement\n:500\n      }\n   },\n   \nduration\n:5000\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis query creates 37 points from 2000 to 20000 in 500 increments to bucketize the duration field using these points as split locations and finds the count of duration values that fall into these intervals.

If two items had \nCount\n within 24 of each other, it is possible that the higher one \nmay\n actually have had a true count \nlower\n than\nthe second one and possibly be ranked higher.

Till we support casting ( #37 ), this will be the behavior automatically enforced by Bullet.   This query is looking for a single event with a specific id and either the page_id is in two specific pages on the \"web\" experience or with a link_id that starts with 2, or a player event where the age is greater than \"65\". In other words, it is looking for senior citizens who generate video player events or the events of a particular person (based on id) events on two specific pages or a group of pages that have link that have ids that start with 2.

The error when the result is estimated is not a Gaussian error function\nand is not described in terms of the values of your field. In other words, if the 50th percentile was estimated to some value, you could not bound the true median by using the the estimated\nvalue +/- constant (see below for a good approximation). The error is expressed in terms of the  normalized rank .

Depending on the distribution, your results could produce different counts and errors bounds if approximate.  Since we only filtered for nulls in a couple of fields, the top results end up being fields with null values. Note that the  maximum_count_error  is now 24 and the  was_estimated  property is\nset to true. 24 means that the upper bound - the lower bound for the  Count  field for each combination could be off by at most 24. Since Bullet gives you the upper bound, this means that if you\nsubtract 24 from it, you get the lower bound of the true count.  Note that this also means the order of the items could be off. If two items had  Count  within 24 of each other, it is possible that the higher one  may  actually have had a true count  lower  than\nthe second one and possibly be ranked higher. There is no such situation in this result set.",

            "text": "The UI Layer\n\n\nThe Bullet UI lets you easily create and work with Bullet queries and results for your custom data. It stores all created queries, results and other metadata in the local browser storage or \nIndexedDB\n.\n\n\n\n\nReally!? Browser Storage only!?\n\n\nWe're serious about the no persistence thing with Bullet! And while we're at it, we are also not interested in supporting old browsers. Joking aside though, we wanted to keep Bullet as light and simple as possible to start with. We can look into extending support from the server-side by adding a database or the like if needed. In practice, we have found that this isn't as important as it initially seems.\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nIn order for your UI to work with Bullet, you should have:\n\n\n\n\nAn instance of the \nbackend\n set up\n\n\nAn instance of the \nWeb Service\n set up\n\n\nYou should also have a Web Service serving your schema (either by using the \nfile based serving\n from the Web Service or your own somewhere else)\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nWe are considering various packaging options at the moment like Docker etc. In the meantime, the following two options are available:\n\n\nGitHub Releases\n\n\n\n\nHead to the \nReleases page\n and grab the latest release\n\n\nDownload the bullet-ui-vX.X.X.tar.gz archive\n\n\nUnarchive it into your web server where you wish to run the UI.\n\n\nInstall \nNode\n (recommend using \nnvm\n to manage Node versions) on the web server\n\n\n\n\nBuild from source\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nNode\n (recommend using \nnvm\n to manage Node versions).\n\n\nInstall \nYarn\n. Use NPM to install it with \nnpm install -g yarn\n\n\nInstall \nEmber\n. \nsudo npm install -g ember-cli\n (sudo required only if not using nvm)\n\n\ngit clone git@github.com:bullet-db/bullet-ui.git\n\n\ncd bullet-ui\n\n\nyarn\n\n\nember build --environment production\n\n\n\n\nThe entire application with all its assets and dependencies are compiled and placed into dist/. You could point a web server directly at this folder but you will \nonly\n be able to use the default configuration (see \nbelow\n).\n\n\nRunning\n\n\nThere is a Node.js server endpoint defined at \nserver/index.js\n to serve the UI. This dynamically injects the settings (see configuration \nbelow\n) into the served UI based on the environment variable NODE_ENV. You should not need to worry about if you only have one environment.\n\n\nThe entry-point for the UI is the \nExpress\n endpoint defined as the main in package.json that simply adds the server/index.js as a middleware.\n\n\nRegardless of which \ninstallation\n option you chose, you need the following folder structure in order to run the UI:\n\n\ndist/*\nconfig/env-settings.json\nserver/index.js\nexpress-server.js\n\n\n\n\nYou can use node to launch the UI from the top-level of the folder structure above.\n\n\nTo launch the UI with the default settings (without specifying proper API endpoints you will not be able to create or run a query):\n\n\nPORT=8800 node express-server.js\n\n\n\n\nTo launch with custom settings:\n\n\nNODE_ENV=\nyour_property_name_from_env-settings.json\n PORT=8800 node express-server.js\n\n\n\n\nVisit localhost:8800 to see your UI that should be configured with the right settings.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe configuration for the UI lets you have different instances of Bullet for different environments (e.g. CI, Staging, Production). These settings can be found in \nenv-settings.json\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqueryHost\n\n\nThe end point (port included) of your Web Service machine that is talking to the Bullet backend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqueryNamespace\n\n\nAny qualifiers you have after your host and port on your Web Service running on your \nqueryHost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqueryPath\n\n\nThe path fragment after the \nqueryNamespace\n on your Web Service running on your \nqueryHost\n for the WebSocket endpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqueryStompRequestChannel\n\n\nThe fragment after this is the Stomp Request channel as configured in your Web Service for the WebSocket endpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqueryStompResponseChannel\n\n\nThe fragment after this is the Stomp Response channel as configured in your Web Service for the WebSocket endpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschemaHost\n\n\nThe end point (port included) of your Web Service machine that is serving your schema in the JSON API format (see \nWeb Service setup\n for details.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschemaNamespace\n\n\nThe path fragment on your schema Web Service running on the \nschemaHost\n. There is no \nschemaPath\n because it \nmust\n be \ncolumns\n in order for the UI to be able fetch the column resource (the fields in your schema).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodelVersion\n\n\nThis is used an indicator to apply changes to the stored queries, results etc. It is monotonically increasing. On startup, changes specified in \nmigrations\n will be applied if the old modelVersion is not present or is \n than this number\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmigrations\n\n\nis an object that currently supports one key: \ndeletions\n of type string. The value can be set to either \nresult\n or \nquery\n. The former wipes all existing results. The latter wipes everything. See \nmodelVersion\n above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhelpLinks\n\n\nIs a list of objects, where each object is a help link. These links populate the \"Help\" drop-down on the UI's top navbar. You can add links to explain your data for example\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefaultQuery\n\n\nCan either be a \nAPI Query\n or a URL from which one could be fetched dynamically. The UI makes this the query created on every newly created Query. You could use this as a way to have user specific (for example, cookie based) filters created for your users or customize an aggregation when they create a new query in the UI. Note that if you have are accessing a map subfield and your field value in the filter is set as \nfoo.bar\n and you want \nbar\n to be the subfield in the UI query builder, you will need to add a key called \nsubfield\n in the filter (not supported by the API) and set its value to \ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbugLink\n\n\nIs a URL that by default points to the issues page for the UI GitHub repository. You can change it to point to your own custom JIRA queue or something else\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefaultValues\n\n\nIs an object that lets you configures defaults for various query parameters and lets you tie your custom backend settings to the UI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the properties in the \ndefaultValues\n object. The Validated column denotes if the value is used when validating a query for correctness and the In Help column denotes if the value is displayed in the popover help messages in the UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Values\n\n\nValidated\n\n\nIn Help\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naggregationMaxSize\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\nThe size used when doing a Count Distinct, Distinct, Group By, or Distribution query. Set this to your max aggregations size in your backend configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrawMaxSize\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\nThe maximum size for a Raw query.

You can also aggregate data, or choose to see raw data records.\n\n\nExample: Finding and picking out fields from events that have probability \n 0.5\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Raw Events\n\n\nA simple but useful query is a query with a filter and a \nSliding Window of size 1\n. This query will run for the extent of your duration and stream back events that match your filters as they arrive:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful\n when you use this query to ensure that your filter is sufficient to avoid returning TOO many results too fast. If this occurs Bullet will kill your query because of rate limiting (the default rate limit is 500 records per second).\n\n\nComplex Filtering\n\n\nThe querybuilder allows you create nested filters (basic relational filters, ANDs and ORs).\n\n\nThe querybuilder is also type aware: Numeric fields only allow numeric values, String fields only allow String operation, etc.\n\n\nExample: Finding and picking out the first and second events in each period that also have probability \n 0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the .* next to a field?\n\n\nIf you have a map that is not enumerated (the keys are not known upfront), there will be \ntwo\n selections for the field in the dropdowns. If you want to apply operations to the nested keys, you can choose the field with the \n.*\n. This will display a free-form subfield selection input where you can specify the key. If you want to apply operations on the entire map, you will need to choose the field without the \n.*\n\n\n\n\nCount Distinct\n\n\nCount Distinct will count the number of distinct elements in a field exactly up to a threshold that is established when the backend is launched (16,384 in the example below).\n\n\nAfter this threshold the count will be approximate. As this example demonstrates, information about the precision of the count can be found in the Metadata:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Can Bullet Count Distinct Elements So Fast??\n\n\nBullet uses \nData Sketches\n to preform the Count Distinct operation extremely quickly and using a configurable amount of memory. The size and precision of the Sketches used is configurable when the backend is launched. Data Sketches provide an estimate of computationally difficult measurements with provable error bounds. Information about the precision of the estimate (such as the Standard Deviations) is available in the Metadata.\n\n\n\n\nGroup all\n\n\nChoosing the Grouped Data option with no fields will result in the metrics being applied to all the data that matches your filters (or the whole set if you have no filters).\n\n\nExample: Counting, summing and averaging on the whole dataset\n\n\nThe metrics you apply on fields are all numeric presently. If you apply a metric on a non-numeric field, Bullet will try to \ntype-cast\n your field into number and if it's not possible, the result will be \nnull\n. The result will also be \nnull\n if the field was not present or no data matched your filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre Grouped Data metrics approximate?\n\n\nNo, the results are all exact. See below to see what is approximated when you have too many unique group combinations.\n\n\n\n\nGroup by\n\n\nYou can also choose Group fields and perform metrics per group.\n\n\nExample: Grouping by tuple_number\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if I group by uuid?\n\n\nTry it out! If the number of unique group values exceeds the \nmaximum configured\n (we used 1024 for this example), you will receive a \nuniform sample\n across your unique group values. The results for your metrics however, are \nnot sampled\n. It is the groups that are sampled on. This means that is \nno\n guarantee of order if you were expecting the \nmost popular\n groups or similar. You should use the Top K query in that scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy no Count Distinct after Grouping\n\n\nAt this time, we do not support counting distinct values per field because with the current implementation of Grouping, it would involve storing DataSketches within DataSketches. We are considering this in a future release however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAha, sorting by tuple_number didn't sort properly!\n\n\nGood job, eagle eyes! Unfortunately, whenever we group on fields, those fields become strings under the current implementation. Rather than convert them back at the end, we have currently decided to leave it as is. This means that in your results, if you try and sort by a grouped field, it will perform a lexicographical sort even if it was originally a number.\n\n\nHowever, this also means that you can actually group by any field - including non primitives such as maps and lists! The field will be converted to a string and that string will be used as the field's representation for uniqueness and grouping purposes.\n\n\n\n\nDistributions\n\n\nIn this example, we find distributions of the \nduration\n  field. This field is generated randomly from 0 to 10,049, with a tendency to have values that are closer to 0. We should be able to see this using Bullet.\n\n\nThe \"distribution\" option allows you to pick a type of distribution:\n\n\n\n\nQuantiles\n lets you get various percentiles (e.g. 25th, 99th) of your numeric field\n\n\nFrequencies\n lets you break up the range of values of your field into intervals and get a count of how many values fell into each interval.\n\n\nCumulative Frequencies\n does the same as \nFrequencies\n but each interval includes the counts of all the intervals prior to it.\n\n\n\n\nBoth \nFrequencies\n and \nCumulative Frequencies\n also give you a probability of how likely a value is to fall into the interval.\n\n\nYou can read much more about this in the UI help by clicking the \nNeed more help?\n link.\n\n\nExact\n\n\nExample: Finding the various percentiles of duration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Finding some frequency counts of duration values in an interval\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out youtself and see what \nCumulative Frequencies\n does!\n\n\nApproximate\n\n\nExample: Approximate quantile distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Rank Error\n\n\nTo understand what this means, refer to the \nexplanation here\n. You can also refer to the help in the Result Metadata section.\n\n\n\n\nTop K\n\n\nTop K lets you get the most \nfrequent items\n or the \nheavy hitters\n for the values in a set of a fields.\n\n\nExact\n\n\nThis example gets the Top 3 most popular \ntype\n values (there are only 6 but this illustrates the idea).\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximate\n\n\nBy adding \nduration\n into the fields, the number of unique values for \n(type, duration)\n is increased. However, because \nduration\n has a tendency to have low values, we will have some \nfrequent items\n. The counts are now estimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Count Error\n\n\nThe \nmaximum_count_error\n value for this query was \n3\n. This means that the difference between the upper bound and the lower bound of each count estimate is \n3\n. Bullet returns the upper bound as the estimate so subtracting \n3\n from each count gives you the lower bound of the count. Note that some counts are closer to each other than the count error. For instance, \n(quux, 1)\n and \n(bar, 1)\n have counts \n79\n and \n78\n but their true counts could be from \n76 to 79\n and \n75 to 78\n respectively. This means that \n(bar, 1)\n could well be the most frequent item for this query.\n\n\n\n\nCharting\n\n\nThis example shows how to get a basic chart in Bullet. The charting and pivoting modes are only enabled for queries that are \nnot\n Count Distinct or Group without Group Fields. This is because these results only have a single row and it does not make sense to graph them. They are enabled for all other queries.\n\n\nThe charting example below shows how to get a quick chart of a \nGroup\n query with 3 metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nTumbling Windows\n\n\nTime-Based Tumbling Windows\n will return results every X seconds:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example groups-by \"type\" and computes a couple metrics for each 2 second window.\n\n\nAdditive Tumbling Windows\n\n\nAdditive tumbling windows\n will also return results every X seconds, but the results will contain all the data collected since the beginning of the query:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example we compute bucket'ed frequency for the \"gaussian\" field. As the query runs you can see the gaussian curve form.\n\n\nPivoting\n\n\nIf the regular chart option is insufficient for your result (for instance, you have too many groups and metrics or you want to post-aggregate your results or remove outliers etc), then there is a advanced Pivot mode available when you are in the Chart option.\n\n\nThe Pivot option provides a drag-and-drop interface to drag fields to breakdown and aggregate by their values. Operations such as finding standard deviations, variance, etc are available as well as easily viewing them as tables and charts.\n\n\nThe following example shows a \nGroup\n query with multiple groups and metrics and some interactions with the Pivot table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw data does have a regular chart mode option\n\n\nThis is deliberate since the Chart option tries to infer your independent and dependent columns. When you fetch raw data, this is prone to errors so only the Pivot option is allowed.",

Starting with 0.5.0, Bullet Storm only includes the logic to implement Bullet on Storm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepository\n\n\nhttps://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-core\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nhttps://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-core/issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Artifact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage Manager Setup\n\n\nSetup for Maven, Gradle etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nRelease\n\n\nHighlights\n\n\nAPIDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-11-21\n\n\n0.6.4\n\n\nExtended field extraction in Projections\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-11-21\n\n\n0.6.3\n\n\nExtended field extraction Filters and Aggregations\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-11-19\n\n\n0.6.2\n\n\nQuery Manager helpers\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-11-16\n\n\n0.6.1\n\n\nQuery Categorizer category\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-11-06\n\n\n0.6.0\n\n\nQuery Partitioning, Validator and other improvements\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-10-21\n\n\n0.5.2\n\n\nAutoCloseable Pubsub Components, HttpClient 4.3.6\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-09-25\n\n\n0.5.1\n\n\nBetter Order By, Smaller Serializations, Transient Fields\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-09-14\n\n\n0.5.0\n\n\nPost Aggregations - ORDER BY, COMPUTATION, Casting in Filters\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-09-05\n\n\n0.4.3\n\n\nSliding Windows, SIZEIS, CONTAINSKEY, CONTAINSVALUE, filtering against other fields\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-06-26\n\n\n0.4.2\n\n\nFixes a bug with unclosed connections in the RESTPubSub\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-06-22\n\n\n0.4.1\n\n\nAdded RESTPublisher HTTP Timeout Setting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-06-18\n\n\n0.4.0\n\n\nAdded support for Integer and Float data types, and configurable BulletRecordProvider class used to instantiate BulletRecords in bullet-core\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-04-11\n\n\n0.3.4\n\n\nPre-Start delaying and Buffering changes - queries are now buffered at the start of a query instead of start of each window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-03-30\n\n\n0.3.3\n\n\nBug fix for com.yahoo.bullet.core.querying.Querier#isClosedForPartition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-03-20\n\n\n0.3.2\n\n\nAdded headers to RESTPubSub http requests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-03-16\n\n\n0.3.1\n\n\nAdded RESTPubSub implementation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-02-22\n\n\n0.3.0\n\n\nSupports windowing / incremental updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-10-04\n\n\n0.2.5\n\n\nSupports an in-memory BufferingSubscriber implementation for reliable subscribing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-10-03\n\n\n0.2.4\n\n\nHelpers added to Config, PubSubMessage, Metadata and JSONFormatter.

Due to major API changes between Storm \n= 0.10 and Storm 1.0, Bullet Storm \nbuilds two artifacts\n. The \nartifactId\n changes from \nbullet-storm\n (for 1.0+) to \nbullet-storm-0.10\n. All releases include migration and testing of the code on \nboth\n versions. Both versions are built simultaneously. Feature parity depends on what was new in Storm 1.0. For example, the Resource Aware Scheduler or RAS, is only present in Storm 1.0+. So, bullet-storm-0.10 removes certain CPU and memory related settings specific to RAS in its configuration. There are also minor changes to the Metrics API in Storm. In terms of Bullet itself, there should be no differences.\n\n\n\n\nStorm DRPC PubSub \n\n\nThe DRPC PubSub is part of this artifact and is fully released and available for use starting with versions 0.6.2 and above. It is only meant to be used if you're using Storm as your Backend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture support\n\n\nWe will support Storm 0.10 for a bit longer till Storm 2.0 is up and stable. Storm versions 1.0+ have a lot of performance fixes and features that you should be running with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorm-1.0+ Repository\n\n\nhttps://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-storm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorm-0.10- Repository\n\n\nhttps://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-storm/tree/storm-0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nhttps://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-storm/issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Artifact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage Manager Setup\n\n\nSetup for Maven, Gradle etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nStorm 1.0\n\n\nStorm 0.10\n\n\nHighlights\n\n\nAPIDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-11-26\n\n\n0.8.5\n\n\n0.8.5\n\n\nExtended field notation and updates bullet-core to 0.6.4\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-11-20\n\n\n0.8.4\n\n\n0.8.4\n\n\nPartitioning and updates bullet-core to 0.6.2\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-06-18\n\n\n0.8.3\n\n\n0.8.3\n\n\nUsing new bullet-record and bullet-core supporting Integer and Float data types\n\n\nJavaDocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-04-12\n\n\n0.8.2\n\n\n0.8.2\n\n\nDelaying query start in Join Bolt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-04-04\n\n\n0.8.1\n\n\n0.8.1\n\n\nFixed bug in JoinBolt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-03-30\n\n\n0.8.0\n\n\n0.8.0\n\n\nSupports windowing / incremental updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-11-07\n\n\n0.7.0\n\n\n0.7.0\n\n\nMerge Query and Metadata Streams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-10-24\n\n\n0.6.2\n\n\n0.6.2\n\n\nAdds a fat jar for using the DRPC PubSub in the Web Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-10-18\n\n\n0.6.1\n\n\n0.6.1\n\n\nDRPC PubSub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-08-30\n\n\n0.6.0\n\n\n0.6.0\n\n\nNew PubSub architecture, removes DRPC components and settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-06-27\n\n\n0.5.0\n\n\n0.5.0\n\n\nPulled out Bullet Core.

Feature parity depends on what was new in Storm 1.0. For example, the Resource Aware Scheduler or RAS, is only present in Storm 1.0+.
