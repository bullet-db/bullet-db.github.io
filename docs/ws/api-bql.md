# Bullet BQL API

This section gives a comprehensive overview of the Web Service API for launching Bullet BQL queries.

For examples of BQL queries, see the [examples page](examples.md).

BQL queries that are received by the Web Service will be detenced and automatically converted to
[the JSON format](api-json.md) before being sent to the backend (which requires the basic JSON format). This converstion
is done in the web service using [the bullet-bql library](../releases/#bullet-bql).

# Overview

Bullet-BQL provides users with a friendly SQL-like API to submit queries to the Web Service.

## Data Types

* **Null**: `NULL`.

* **Boolean**: `TRUE`, `FALSE`.

* **Integer**: 32-bit signed two’s complement integer with a minimum value of `-2^31` and a maximum value of `2^31 - 1`. Example: `65`.

* **Long**: 64-bit signed two’s complement integer with a minimum value of `-2^63 + 1` and a maximum value of `2^63 - 1`. Example: `9223372036854775807`, `-9223372036854775807`.

* **Double**: 64-bit inexact, variable-precision with a minimum value of `2^-1074` and a maximum value of `(2-2^-52)·2^1023`. Example: `1.7976931348623157E+308`, `.17976931348623157E+309`, `4.9E-324`.

* **Decimal**: decimal number can be treated as Double, String or ParsingException. This is controlled by `ParsingOptions`. `1.7976931348623157`, `.17976931348623157`.

* **String**: character string which can have escapes. Example: `'this is a string'`, `'this is ''another'' string'`.

* **ColumnReference**: representation of a single column. Unquoted ColumnReference must start with a letter or `_`. Quoted ColumnReference can have escape. Example: `column_name`, `"#column""with""escape"`.

* **Dereference**: representation of a column field. Example: `column_name.field_name`.

* **All**: representation of all columns. Example: `*`. `column_name.*` is interpreted as `column_name`.

## Reserved Keywords

Reserved keywords must be double quoted in order to be used as ColumnReference or Dereference.

`value_expr` is one of Null, Boolean, Integer, Long, Double, Decimal and String. 

and `groupBy_clause` is one of

    ()                                                                group all
    reference_expr ( , reference_expr )*                              group by
    ( reference_expr ( , reference_expr )* )                          group by
    
and `HAVING` and `ORDER BY` are only supported for TopK. In which case, `having_clause` is 

    COUNT(*) >= Integer
    
and `orderBy_clause` is

    COUNT(*)

and `windowing_clause` is one of 

    ( EVERY, ( Integer | Long ), ( TIME | RECORD ), include )
    ( TUMBLING, ( Integer | Long ), ( TIME | RECORD ) )

`include` is one of 

    ALL
    FIRST, ( Integer | Long ), ( TIME | RECORD )
    LAST, ( Integer | Long ), ( TIME | RECORD )                       will be supported

and `limit_clause` is one of

    Integer | Long 
    ALL                                                               will be supported
